Its intricate system of bronze gears was designed to model astronomical phenomena with remarkable precision. The prevailing interpretation, championed by researchers like Derek de Solla Price, is that its primary function was scientific and predictive. By tracking the positions of the sun, moon, and planets, and forecasting lunar and solar eclipses, the device served as a sophisticated calendrical calculator, embodying the pinnacle of ancient Greek astronomical knowledge for practical use.\n\n**Text 2**\n\nWhile acknowledging the mechanical genius of the Antikythera mechanism, historian Alexander Jones proposes a reevaluation of its core purpose. He argues that the assumption of a purely scientific, predictive function may be anachronistic\u2014a projection of modern priorities. Jones suggests that the mechanism was less a practical tool for astronomers and more a philosophical instrument intended for public display or teaching. Its true purpose, in this view, was not merely to predict celestial events but to demonstrate the orderly, predictable nature of the cosmos (*kosmos*) as understood in Greek philosophy. The device was a tangible model of a philosophical ideal, not a utilitarian computer for generating data.\n\nBased on the texts, how would historian Alexander Jones (Text 2) most likely characterize the \"prevailing interpretation\" of the Antikythera mechanism mentioned in Text 1?"

Proponents of this \"drought hypothesis\" point to extensive paleoclimatological data, such as sediment cores from regional lakes, which indicate a series of prolonged and severe droughts occurred in the 9th and 10th centuries. According to this model, these climatic shifts led to widespread agricultural failure, triggering famine, social unrest, and ultimately the abandonment of the great lowland cities. The environmental cataclysm is thus seen as the principal external shock that overwhelmed Maya society.\n\n**Text 2**\n\nRecent research led by archaeologist Takeshi Inomata challenges the narrative that environmental factors were the unilateral cause of the Maya collapse. Analyzing high-precision radiocarbon dates from the Ceibal archaeological site, Inomata\u2019s team has demonstrated that significant political instability and warfare predated the most severe droughts by several decades. Their findings suggest that escalating warfare led to the initial decline of Maya political systems, dismantling the very social and administrative structures that would have been necessary to coordinate a response to environmental hardship. In this revised view, Maya civilization was already in a state of advanced political collapse when the droughts arrived, rendering societies exceptionally vulnerable to a climatic stressor they might have otherwise endured.\n\nBased on the texts, how would Inomata\u2019s team (Text 2) most likely respond to the \"prevailing view\" presented in Text 1?"
