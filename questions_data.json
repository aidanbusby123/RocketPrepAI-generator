It shows both Dorothea's powerful intellectual ambition (her desire to learn ancient languages from her husband, Mr. Casaubon) and how that ambition is constrained and misdirected by her social role. She cannot pursue this knowledge directly because she fears being \"tiresome\"\u2014a reflection of the social expectation for women to be accommodating. Instead, she must channel her ambition into a subservient, socially acceptable role: \"helping him with his copier\u2019s work.\" This perfectly captures the critic's argument that her formidable intellectual drive, lacking a proper outlet, is funneled into the limited project of her marriage.",
            "B": "This quotation directly contradicts the critic's claim. The claim argues that Dorothea\u2019s ambition is a \"formidable drive\" that is not \"inherently misguided.\" This quotation, however, portrays her ambition as a character flaw\u2014a \"persecuting scrupulosity\" and a form of piety that makes her feel superior to other women (\"a Pharisee\"). This suggests the problem is internal to Dorothea's character, rather than an external issue of her ambition being constrained by society."

In this view, science advances through a meticulous, cumulative process. Scientists propose specific, testable hypotheses to incrementally improve upon existing theoretical frameworks. These hypotheses are then subjected to empirical testing, with the goal of identifying and eliminating errors. Theories that withstand this scrutiny are provisionally retained, not as absolute truths, but as the best current approximations. This process is seen as a logical, linear march toward a more accurate understanding of the natural world.\n\n### Text 2\n\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s historical analysis of science presents a contrasting picture, arguing that the purely logical model overlooks crucial social and psychological dynamics. Kuhn introduces a distinction between \"normal science\"\u2014the routine, puzzle-solving work conducted within an unquestioned theoretical \"paradigm\"\u2014and revolutionary \"paradigm shifts.\" These shifts, like the Copernican Revolution, are not merely logical updates based on new data. Instead, they represent fundamental, non-cumulative ruptures in a scientific community's worldview, often driven as much by persuasion and generational change as by empirical evidence.\n\n---\n\nBased on the texts, how would Thomas Kuhn (Text 2) most likely characterize the model of scientific progress described in Text 1?"

To read Joyce\u2019s novel is, for many, to navigate a torrent of disconnected thoughts, esoteric allusions, and abrupt shifts in style. This perception, however, while capturing the reader's immediate experience, risks mistaking the *effect* for the *method*. Joyce\u2019s project, far from being an uncontrolled outpouring, was one of meticulous, almost fanatical, control. The novel\u2019s putatively random elements are, in fact, part of a methodical orchestration designed to perform a specific mimetic function: to represent not just the content of consciousness, but its very structure and the arbitrary, contingent nature of urban experience itself. The fragmentation is the point, not a byproduct of artistic abandon.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?"

        "question": "### Text 1\n\nThe narrative voice of George Eliot\u2019s 1871 novel *Middlemarch* is often defined by its magisterial omniscience. The narrator is framed as a secular deity, surveying the town\u2019s inhabitants from an olympian height. With total access to their interior lives and a deep grasp of their social world, the narrator acts as an unimpeachable moral arbiter. The narrative tone is one of inherent authority and objective judgment, delivering insights into human fallibility with a finality that seems to transcend mere storytelling.\n\n### Text 2\n\nTo accept the *Middlemarch* narrator\u2019s authority as an inherent \"god-like\" quality, however, is to miss the elaborate rhetorical performance that establishes it. Critic D. A. Miller argues that the narrator\u2019s power is not given but earned. By occasionally performing uncertainty\u2014using phrases like \"perhaps\" or admitting to interpretive limits\u2014the narrator forges a bond of trust with the reader. This self-conscious strategy does not undermine the narrator's authority but rather constructs it as something persuasive and relational, transforming the act of judgment from a top-down decree into a shared intellectual journey.\n\n---\n\nBased on the texts, how would D. A. Miller (Text 2) most likely respond to the characterization of the *Middlemarch* narrator in Text 1?"

        "question": "*The following text is from a critical essay on Toni Morrison\u2019s 1987 novel, Beloved.*\n\n    To interpret Toni Morrison\u2019s *Beloved* as primarily a ghost story about the psychological inheritance of trauma is to grasp its emotional core but miss its profound epistemological challenge. This common reading frames the novel as a powerful, albeit personal, drama of one woman\u2019s confrontation with her past. Such an analysis, however, overlooks Morrison's broader critique of historical narration itself. The novel\u2019s narrative structure, which eschews linear chronology in favor of a fragmented, recursive, and supernaturally-inflected account, is not merely a stylistic flourish. It is a deliberate argument that the systematic brutality of slavery constitutes a kind of historical \"unspeakable\"\u2014an experience so profound in its violence that it fractures conventional methods of record and representation. The novel is thus less a psychological case study and more an attempt to forge a new narrative form capable of bearing witness to a history that defies traditional telling.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?"

The narrator, Jane, has just arrived at Thornfield Hall, the home of her new employer, and is being shown around by the housekeeper.\n\n> Following the housekeeper, I passed through a long gallery, whose walls were lined with family portraits. From this gallery we were conducted to a staircase. The staircase was of oak; the steps and banisters were black and polished. I thought I had got into a fairy place, so bright and splendid were the train of rooms that appeared in perspective before me. The ride to get here had been wild and tedious, and my spirits had descended to a very low ebb.

Text 1 states that the traditional view focuses on Victor's 'scientific hubris' and 'unfettered scientific ambition' as the novel's main theme. Text 2, presenting Anne K.

Mellor shifts the focus from a critique of science to a 'failure of parental and societal empathy,' which is a form of social responsibility. Therefore, she would argue that the traditional view overemphasizes scientific ambition while overlooking the more central theme of social and parental failure."

        "question": "**Text 1**\n\tLiterary interpretations of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* have traditionally centered on Victor Frankenstein's hubris as the novel\u2019s tragic flaw. In this view, the novel is a quintessential cautionary tale, a Romantic-era critique of unfettered scientific ambition. Victor, by transgressing the boundaries of nature and \"playing God,\" unleashes a destructive force he cannot control. The subsequent havoc wrought by his creation is understood primarily as the consequence of this initial scientific transgression. The narrative is thus framed as the tragedy of an overreaching creator whose ambition leads to his ruin.\n\n**Text 2**\n\tRecent scholarship on *Frankenstein* has challenged the primacy of scientific hubris in the novel's thematic structure. Critic Anne K. Mellor, for example, posits that the true tragedy stems not from Victor's act of creation, but from his subsequent emotional and social abandonment of his creation. From this perspective, the novel\u2019s focus is on the Creature's suffering\u2014his desperate quest for sympathy and his turn to violence only after being brutally rejected. Shelley's critique, therefore, is aimed less at the pursuit of knowledge and more at a failure of parental and societal empathy, the refusal to nurture and accept the unfamiliar \"other.\"\n\nBased on the texts, how would Anne K. Mellor (as described in Text 2) most likely respond to the \"traditional\" interpretation of *Frankenstein* presented in Text 1?"

        "question": "Tardigrades, microscopic invertebrates, are renowned for their ability to survive extreme dehydration. For decades, the precise molecular mechanisms protecting their cells from fatal damage during this process remained a subject of intense scientific inquiry. A team led by biologist Takekazu Kunieda hypothesized that a unique set of proteins, known as cytoplasmic-abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, were key. Investigating this, they introduced CAHS proteins into cultured human cells and then subjected them to dehydration. The researchers found that the proteins formed a protective, gel-like bioglass, yet this structure only partially accounted for the cells' resilience, suggesting that while CAHS proteins are important, they are not the sole factor in tardigrade survival.\n\nWhich choice best describes the overall structure of the text?"

They provide continuous, 24/7 power.\n*   The initial construction of a nuclear power plant is extremely expensive and can take over a decade.\n*   A key long-term challenge for nuclear power is the management of long-lived radioactive waste, which requires secure and permanent storage.\n*   Large-scale solar farms require vast areas of land to generate an equivalent amount of power (low energy density).\n*   Solar farms are intermittent, generating power only when the sun shines. This creates a need for expensive, large-scale battery storage systems to ensure grid stability.\n*   Solar power produces no waste or emissions during operation, and the costs of solar panels have fallen significantly.\n\nThe student is writing an essay about the challenges of transitioning to a clean energy grid.

Paleoclimatological data, particularly from Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula sediment cores, indicates a period of intense aridification coinciding with the abandonment of major urban centers. Proponents of this 'great drought' hypothesis posit a direct causal chain: decreased rainfall led to agricultural collapse, which in turn undermined the authority of the ruling elite and precipitated demographic decline. In this view, the environmental shock was the principal, exogenous force that dismantled the civilization.\n\nText 2\n\nWhile the evidence for drought during the Terminal Classic period is robust, many researchers challenge its designation as the fundamental cause of the Maya collapse. Their work points to endogenous structural decay that predates the aridification. Indicators such as intensified inter-polity warfare, fracturing of long-distance trade networks, and a decline in monumental construction suggest a political system already experiencing a crisis of integration. This school of thought posits that the civilization's sociopolitical framework had become too fragmented to manage resources or respond to ecological pressures effectively. The droughts, therefore, acted as an accelerant upon a society whose systemic vulnerabilities had already made it fragile, hastening a collapse ultimately rooted in internal dysfunction.\n\n---\n\nBased on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely characterize the \"direct causal chain\" described in Text 1?"

As CO\u2082 dissolves in seawater, it lowers the water's pH. Researchers hypothesize that this increased acidity interferes with shell-building in calcifying organisms like oysters. They propose that lower pH levels reduce the availability of carbonate ions, a key building block for shells. Furthermore, they posit that this detrimental effect is **significantly exacerbated by rising sea temperatures**, which add physiological stress and may further inhibit the calcification process. The combined impact, they argue, leads to shells that are critically weaker and thinner.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?"

According to this view, the phenomenon was driven by workers seizing the opportunity presented by a tight labor market to switch jobs for better pay, improved benefits, or more agreeable working conditions. The high number of job openings gave employees unprecedented leverage. Consequently, the wave of resignations is best understood not as a rejection of work itself, but as a strategic move to secure better employment within the existing economic framework.\n\n### Text 2\n\nWhile the pursuit of better jobs was certainly a factor, sociologist Adelle Monteblanco argues that framing the Great Resignation as a mere \"reshuffling\" misses a more profound cultural shift. She posits that the pandemic acted as a societal shock that severed many people's long-held attachments to their careers and workplaces. This psychological unmooring prompted a widespread re-evaluation of the role of work in life, leading many to seek not just a better job, but a different relationship with labor altogether\u2014one with more autonomy, meaning, or a smaller footprint in their daily lives. Thus, the phenomenon represents a change in worker priorities, not just a response to market conditions.\n\n---\n\nBased on the texts, how would Adelle Monteblanco (Text 2) most likely respond to the characterization of the Great Resignation in Text 1?"
