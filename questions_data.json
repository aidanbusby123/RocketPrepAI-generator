However, it does not directly address the specific argument made by the critics. The claim is about her *intellectual* ambition and how it becomes channeled into her marriage. This quotation focuses on her spiritual and ethical values in a general sense, without connecting them to her intellectual pursuits or the way they are misdirected by her circumstances.",
            "C": "This quotation most effectively illustrates the full, nuanced claim presented in the passage. It shows both Dorothea's powerful intellectual ambition (her desire to learn ancient languages from her husband, Mr. Casaubon) and how that ambition is constrained and misdirected by her social role. She cannot pursue this knowledge directly because she fears being \"tiresome\"\u2014a reflection of the social expectation for women to be accommodating. Instead, she must channel her ambition into a subservient, socially acceptable role: \"helping him with his copier\u2019s work.\" This perfectly captures the critic's argument that her formidable intellectual drive, lacking a proper outlet, is funneled into the limited project of her marriage.",
            "B": "This quotation directly contradicts the critic's claim. The claim argues that Dorothea\u2019s ambition is a \"formidable drive\" that is not \"inherently misguided.\" This quotation, however, portrays her ambition as a character flaw\u2014a \"persecuting scrupulosity\" and a form of piety that makes her feel superior to other women (\"a Pharisee\"). This suggests the problem is internal to Dorothea's character, rather than an external issue of her ambition being constrained by society."

Rothko, on the other hand, saw his work as communicating \"basic human emotions\" through \"non-representational fields of color.\" While they disagreed on the *source* of the paintings' power (form vs. emotion), both perspectives are based on the understanding that the paintings are abstract. Neither view relies on the works depicting a recognizable person, landscape, or object. Therefore, both parties would agree that the paintings' impact does not depend on traditional representation.",

For the formalist critics, this choice is directly contradictory to their view. The text states they believed the work's power was in its \"purification of the medium, not in any external emotional narrative,\" meaning they would reject the idea that eliciting an emotional response was the primary goal at all.",

The formalist critics would not agree with the statement that they \"failed\"; rather, they would argue that their focus on formal qualities was the correct way to assess the art, and that emotional interpretation was misguided. This choice describes the conflict itself, not a point of agreement."

Hurston\u2019s approach, by contrast, was uniquely informed by her rigorous training as an anthropologist. Her extensive fieldwork was not a hunt for quaint anecdotes but a deep, scholarly immersion into the cultural systems of the communities she studied. This academic discipline provided the crucial framework for her fiction, allowing her to translate the intricate oral traditions of the Black diaspora into literature with an unprecedented authenticity. Her novels thus represent a deliberate fusion of artistic expression and ethnographic insight, a synthesis that distinguished her from many other writers of her era.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?"

It is a deliberate argument that the systematic brutality of slavery constitutes a kind of historical \"unspeakable\"\u2014an experience so profound in its violence that it fractures conventional methods of record and representation.

In this view, the novel is a quintessential cautionary tale, a Romantic-era critique of unfettered scientific ambition. Victor, by transgressing the boundaries of nature and \"playing God,\" unleashes a destructive force he cannot control.

The narrative is thus framed as the tragedy of an overreaching creator whose ambition leads to his ruin.\n\n**Text 2**\n\tRecent scholarship on *Frankenstein* has challenged the primacy of scientific hubris in the novel's thematic structure. Critic Anne K. Mellor, for example, posits that the true tragedy stems not from Victor's act of creation, but from his subsequent emotional and social abandonment of his creation. From this perspective, the novel\u2019s focus is on the Creature's suffering\u2014his desperate quest for sympathy and his turn to violence only after being brutally rejected. Shelley's critique, therefore, is aimed less at the pursuit of knowledge and more at a failure of parental and societal empathy, the refusal to nurture and accept the unfamiliar \"other.\"\n\nBased on the texts, how would Anne K.

One secular perspective views Myshkin's Christ-like goodness as a form of profound naivete, a psychological passivity that is simply incommensurable with the corrupt, manipulative society he enters. In this reading, the disastrous outcomes of his actions stem directly from his idealism\u2019s inherent inefficacy. A competing, more metaphysical interpretation, however, posits that Myshkin\u2019s goodness is genuine and absolute. For these critics, the tragedy lies not in a flaw within Myshkin\u2019s character, but in a fallen world's incapacity to receive such pure compassion without perverting it.

One of the most significant was the creation of standardized time zones. As railroad networks expanded across vast distances, their reliance on precise schedules made local, sun-based time systems untenable.

        "question": "The following text describes a scientific hypothesis about ocean acidification.\n\n\tOcean acidification, driven by increased atmospheric CO\u2082, threatens marine ecosystems. As CO\u2082 dissolves in seawater, it lowers the water's pH. Researchers hypothesize that this increased acidity interferes with shell-building in calcifying organisms like oysters. They propose that lower pH levels reduce the availability of carbonate ions, a key building block for shells. Furthermore, they posit that this detrimental effect is **significantly exacerbated by rising sea temperatures**, which add physiological stress and may further inhibit the calcification process. The combined impact, they argue, leads to shells that are critically weaker and thinner.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?"

Finally, it reveals a critical flaw in that second model as well ('not without its own difficulties'). Therefore, the main idea is to present this complex situation: a core problem (justification), two potential solutions (foundationalism and coherentism), and the 'significant philosophical difficulties inherent to both.'",
            "B": "This is a 'Mischaracterization' distractor. The text presents coherentism as an alternative to foundationalism but immediately follows its description with a significant criticism (it could be 'entirely detached from reality'). The passage maintains a neutral, analytical tone and does not conclude that one model is more defensible than the other; instead, it shows that both face serious challenges."

        "question": "The following text is from an essay on epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge.\n\nIn epistemology, the common-sense view of knowledge is often foundationalist: a logical edifice where beliefs are justified by their connection to putatively self-evident truths. The tenability of this model is challenged, however, by the fact that these so-called foundations\u2014whether sensory or rational\u2014can themselves be questioned. In turn, coherentist theories discard the architectural metaphor for a systemic one, like a web of mutually supporting beliefs. Here, justification arises not from a privileged base, but from a belief\u2019s contribution to the system's overall consistency. This view is not without its own difficulties; critics note that a perfectly coherent system of beliefs could be entirely detached from reality, raising the question of whether coherence alone is a sufficient standard for truth.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?"
