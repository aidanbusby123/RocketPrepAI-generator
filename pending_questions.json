For decades, the prevailing view was that these non-coding regions were largely functionless evolutionary remnants. However, large-scale genomic projects, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), have systematically dismantled this assumption. Research now shows that a significant portion of this so-called \u201cjunk\u201d is transcribed into non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in gene regulation, controlling when and where genes are turned on or off. Furthermore, many non-coding sequences act as binding sites for proteins that orchestrate the complex three-dimensional folding of chromosomes, a process vital for proper gene expression. The dismissal of non-coding DNA as mere \"junk\" stemmed not from its actual lack of utility, but from an overly narrow definition of biological function.\n\nWhich choice most accurately describes the author\u2019s primary line of reasoning?",
