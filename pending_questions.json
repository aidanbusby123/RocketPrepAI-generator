            "A": "This choice is incorrect. 'Subsequently' means 'afterward' and indicates a sequence in time. While the increased profitability occurred after the invention's increased speed, this choice fails to capture the stronger causal relationship between the two events. The profitability was a direct result of the efficiency, not just something that happened later.",
            "B": "This choice is incorrect. 'In effect' is used to summarize or state the practical result of something, meaning 'in essence'. While plausible, it is less precise than a word that signals a direct logical consequence. 'Consequently' more accurately describes the cause-and-effect relationship.",
            "C": "This is the correct answer. The first sentence establishes a cause: the cotton gin made separating cotton fibers much faster. The second sentence describes the direct result or logical effect of this increased efficiency. 'Consequently' correctly signals this cause-and-effect relationship.",
            "D": "This choice is incorrect. 'Additionally' is used to add another separate point or piece of information. The increased profitability is not a separate, added idea but a direct consequence of the increased efficiency mentioned."

        "question": "While researching the history of common technologies, a student has compiled the following notes:\n\n*   The name \"Bluetooth\" is a tribute to a 10th-century Danish king, Harald \"Bluetooth\" Gormsson.\n*   King Harald was famous for uniting different Danish tribes into a single kingdom.\n*   The king's nickname likely came from a discolored, dead tooth.\n*   In 1996, tech companies like Intel and Ericsson needed a temporary codename for a new technology that would unite different devices (like phones and computers).\n*   An engineer named Jim Kardach suggested \"Bluetooth,\" drawing a parallel between the king uniting tribes and the technology uniting devices.\n*   The codename became so popular it was made the official brand name.\n\nThe student wants to write a sentence that briefly explains the origin of the name \"Bluetooth\". Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

            "C. Harald Gormsson, a Danish king from the 10th century, got the nickname \"Bluetooth\" because he had a discolored tooth.",

            "B": "This choice is correct because it perfectly achieves the rhetorical goal. It synthesizes information from several notes to explain who Bluetooth was named after (King Harald) and why (his role as a unifier parallels the technology's function of uniting devices).",
            "C": "This choice is incorrect because it only explains the origin of the king's nickname, not why the technology was named after him. It is factually accurate but does not fulfill the student's goal.",
            "D": "This choice is incorrect because it misrepresents the information in the notes, which state that \"Bluetooth\" was initially a temporary codename, not the intended official name from the start."
