        "question": "A lay conception of history often treats it as a veridical chronicle of bygone eras, a straightforward ledger of events as they occurred. However, scholars working in the field of historical memory have long contended that this view is, at best, incomplete. They argue that what societies treat as their collective past is not a passive reflection but an active, and often contentious, construction. This process of remembering is profoundly shaped by present-day imperatives\u2014(by, for example, the need to forge a national identity or legitimize a political order)\u2014and is thus inherently selective. By this logic, the past that is \"remembered\" is less a definitive record and more a discursive field, a terrain where meanings are produced and contested, often with a teleological aim of explaining or justifying the present.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?",

Proponents of this view argue that figures like Napoleon Bonaparte or Julius Caesar were not merely products of their time but were, in fact, powerful catalysts whose singular vision and personal charisma fundamentally altered the course of events. In this framework, major historical turning points are seen as the direct result of the choices and leadership of these influential figures, without whom history would have unfolded very differently.\n\n**Text 2**\n\nHistorian Jia Li critiques the traditional \u201cGreat Man\u201d theory as overly simplistic. While acknowledging the significant impact of certain individuals, Li argues that their influence is largely contingent upon pre-existing societal conditions. For a leader\u2019s vision to be realized, the social, technological, and economic currents of the era must be receptive. According to Li, a figure like Napoleon could only rise to power because the French Revolution had already destabilized the old order and created a widespread desire for strong leadership. Thus, such individuals are better understood as successful navigators of historical forces rather than their originators.\n\nHow would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the characterization of historical change presented in Text 1?",

            "B": "This choice incorrectly interprets the study's findings. While the study found 'no single gene' that acted as a simple switch, it did find that migratory ability is 'linked to a collection of different genes.' This means there are genetic differences, making the claim that there is 'no fundamental genetic difference' a direct contradiction of the evidence presented. This distractor preys on a misreading of 'no single gene' as 'no genes at all.'",
            "C": "The text presents a direct contrast between an old assumption and a new finding. The old assumption was that a 'single, critical \\\"migration gene\\\"' was responsible for the behavior. The new finding is that 'no single gene' is responsible; rather, it is a 'collection of different genes' and their 'differing *expression*.' The correct choice, C, perfectly synthesizes this contrast by stating that migration is determined not by a single gene's presence/absence but by 'a more complex genetic regulation,' which is a precise summary of the role of gene expression across a suite of genes.",
            "D": "This choice makes a plausible-sounding leap that is not supported by the text. The passage mentions that the relevant genes are related to 'metabolism,' which is linked to energy. However, the text is purely descriptive of the genetic mechanism; it makes no claims about the *evolutionary advantages* of either migrating or not migrating. Concluding that energy conservation is the 'primary evolutionary advantage' is an assumption that goes beyond the scope of the provided information."
