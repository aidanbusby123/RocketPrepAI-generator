Its intricate system of bronze gears was designed to model astronomical phenomena with remarkable precision. The prevailing interpretation, championed by researchers like Derek de Solla Price, is that its primary function was scientific and predictive. By tracking the positions of the sun, moon, and planets, and forecasting lunar and solar eclipses, the device served as a sophisticated calendrical calculator, embodying the pinnacle of ancient Greek astronomical knowledge for practical use.\\n\\n**Text 2**\\n\\nWhile acknowledging the mechanical genius of the Antikythera mechanism, historian Alexander Jones proposes a reevaluation of its core purpose. He argues that the assumption of a purely scientific, predictive function may be anachronistic\u2014a projection of modern priorities. Jones suggests that the mechanism was less a practical tool for astronomers and more a philosophical instrument intended for public display or teaching. Its true purpose, in this view, was not merely to predict celestial events but to demonstrate the orderly, predictable nature of the cosmos (*kosmos*) as understood in Greek philosophy.

They should be tempting to a student who has a general understanding but lacks precise recall or analytical depth.\n\n        Semantic Overlap: Create greater semantic overlap between the correct answer and the distractors, where the differences are only apparent upon close, critical reading.\n\n        False Authority/Completeness: A distractor might present a statement that sounds authoritative or complete but is factually incomplete or subtly inaccurate according to the source text.\n\n    Conciseness & Efficiency: Eliminate any redundant words or phrases. Every word in the stem and options should serve a distinct purpose in assessing the student's understanding. SAT questions are dense and efficient.\n\n    Avoid 'Trickiness' vs. 'Rigor': The difficulty should stem from intellectual rigor (deep comprehension, precise analysis, subtle distinction) rather than from overt 'tricks' or obscure, pedantic details not inferable from the given information.\n\n    Maintain Logical Flow: Despite increased complexity, the question and options must still maintain a clear, logical flow of ideas.\n\n    Consider a 'Best Fit' Scenario: Frame the question to ask for the best explanation among plausible options, rather than the only correct one.

For example, the vowel in \"feet\" was pronounced like the modern \"a\" in \"fate.\"\n\t\u2022 A central debate among historical linguists is the GVS\u2019s causal mechanism: what initiated the chain reaction of vowel changes?\n\t\u2022 The \u201cpull-chain\u201d theory suggests the highest long vowels (/i\u02d0/ and /u\u02d0/) became diphthongs first. This created a \"vocalic space\" at the top of the phonetic chart, \"pulling\" the next-highest vowels upward to fill the gap.\n\t\u2022 The \u201cpush-chain\u201d theory posits the opposite: the lowest long vowels (/e\u02d0/ and /o\u02d0/) began to be pronounced higher in the mouth. This crowded the space for the vowels above them, \"pushing\" them upward in the phonetic chart.\n\t\u2022 The result of the GVS is a major source of the discrepancy between modern English spelling, which was largely standardized before the shift was complete, and modern English pronunciation.\n\nThe student wants to write a sentence that explains the fundamental point of disagreement between the two main theories regarding the GVS.
