Context:
You are to generate SAT Reading and Writing section questions that assess a student’s skill in interpreting the structure and purpose of texts. Focus on the “Craft and Structure” domain and specifically target “Text Structure and Purpose.” Your task is to create a short, standalone passage and an associated question with four answer choices (one correct, three distractors), in line with the patterns, logic, and rigor of official SAT questions. You are given a difficulty of {difficulty}.

You are an expert content creator for SAT test preparation. Your task is to generate high-quality questions that evaluate a student's ability to analyze "Text Structure and Purpose," a key skill in the SAT Reading and Writing section.

Your output must be a single, complete test question item, including:
1.  A short, self-contained text (60-150 words).
2.  A multiple-choice question about the text's structure or purpose.
3.  Four answer choices (A, B, C, D).
4.  The correct answer and a detailed rationale explaining why it is correct and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Step-by-Step Generation Process:**

**Step 1: Choose a Core Rhetorical Structure**
Your text must be built on a clear logical backbone. Select one of the following structures:

*   **Structure A: Challenge/Complication.**
    1.  Introduce a prevailing theory, common belief, historical situation, or artistic/literary style.
    2.  Introduce a piece of evidence, a study, a thinker, or a new development that challenges, complicates, qualifies, or rejects the initial idea. (Use transition words like "However," "But," "This is challenged by...").
    3.  Explain the new finding or idea and its implications.
*   **Structure B: Problem/Inquiry/Finding.**
    1.  State a scientific problem, an unresolved question, or a phenomenon that is not fully understood.
    2.  Describe a specific hypothesis, study, or method that a researcher or team used to investigate the problem.
    3.  State the finding or conclusion. For added complexity, make the finding contradict or fail to fully support the initial hypothesis.
*   **Structure C: General Concept & Specific Illustration.**
    1.  State a general claim or introduce a broad concept (e.g., a literary technique, a scientific principle, a historical trend).
    2.  Provide a concrete, specific example that illustrates, defines, or grounds the general concept.
    3.  Briefly explain how the example connects to the concept.

**Step 2: Select an Academic Topic**
Choose a topic from one of the following areas. The content should be sophisticated but not require outside knowledge to understand.
*   **Science:** Biology, astronomy, chemistry, environmental science.
*   **Social Science/History:** History, archaeology, sociology, economics, art history, linguistics.
*   **Humanities/Literary Criticism:** Analysis of a literary technique, a specific author's style, a philosophical idea, or an element from a poem or story.

**Step 3: Write the Text**
Draft the 60-150 word text following your chosen structure and topic. Use formal, academic language. Ensure all information needed to answer the question is contained within the text.

**Step 4: Formulate the Question**
Your question must target the rhetorical logic of the text. Choose one of these two formats:

*   **Function Question:** Underline one or two key sentences that serve a distinct purpose within the text's structure (e.g., the sentence that introduces the challenge, states the finding, or provides the example). Ask: **"Which choice best describes the function of the underlined [sentence/portion] in the text as a whole?"**
*   **Overall Structure Question:** Do not underline any part of the text. Ask: **"Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?"** or **"Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?"**

**Step 5: Craft the Answer Choices (This is Critical for Quality)**

*   **The Correct Answer (Key):** Write one choice that accurately describes the rhetorical function or overall structure using precise, abstract vocabulary. It must correctly capture the logical relationships in the text. Use words like: *introduces, presents, describes, challenges, qualifies, complicates, provides reasoning for, offers an example of, summarizes the effects of, defines, illustrates.*

*   **The Distractors (Incorrect Choices):** Create three plausible but clearly incorrect distractors using these classic SAT traps:
    *   **The "Describes a Different Part" Trap:** Write a choice that accurately describes the function of a *different* sentence in the passage.
    *   **The "Right Content, Wrong Function" Trap:** Write a choice that correctly summarizes the information in the underlined section but misidentifies its role or purpose within the overall argument.
    *   **The "Factual Contradiction" Trap:** Write a choice that directly contradicts the information or the logical flow of the text (e.g., says something "supports" a claim when the text says it "challenges" it).
    *   **The "Unsupported Leap" Trap:** Write a choice that makes a plausible-sounding inference that is not explicitly supported by the text provided.

**Step 6: Write the Rationale**
Clearly label the correct answer. Then, provide a detailed rationale. First, explain precisely why the correct answer is the best choice, linking it back to the text. Then, for each of the three distractors, explain exactly why it is incorrect, referencing one of the "trap" types from Step 5.

### The majority of plastics today wind up in landfills or are, at best, recycled into materials that have a very
limited range of applications. To address this problem, chemist Guoliang Liu and colleagues designed a
reactor that melts polyethylene and polypropylene—two widely used plastics—into a wax. The wax can then
be transformed into a surfactant (a chemical compound usable as a detergent). With this promising new
method, plastic waste could be turned into a range of useful cleaning products.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion of the text?
A. It clarifies the meaning of a scientific term.
B. It describes an environmental concern.
C. It explains the significance of a scientific discovery.
D. It identifies a result that confused the team.

### Correct Answer: A
### Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined phrase functions in the text as a
whole. The text states that the wax produced by Liu and colleagues’ reactor can be turned into a surfactant. The underlined
phrase, which is set off with parentheses, then provides a definition for the term "surfactant," explaining that it’s a chemical
compound that can be used as a detergent. Thus, the underlined portion of the text functions to clarify the meaning of a
scientific term.
Choice B is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses broadly on an environmental concern, the underlined phrase does
not; it simply indicates what a surfactant is. Choice C is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses on a scientific
discovery (Liu and colleagues’ solution to the problem of plastic recycling), the underlined phrase does not explain its
significance; it simply defines a scientific term used in the discussion. Choice D is incorrect. Though the text as a whole
includes discussion of the result found by Liu and colleagues, the underlined phrase does not discuss it; it simply defines a
scientific term used in the discussion. Additionally, at no point in the text is it mentioned that the team was confused.

### Individual elephants and Arctic herbivores such as caribou tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout
their lifetimes, which had prompted some researchers to speculate that the Arctic woolly mammoth, an
extinct elephantid, might have exhibited similar behavior. Mammoth tusks grew in sequential layers,
incorporating ingested minerals and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the ratio of strontium
isotopes ( Sr/ Sr) in the local environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows where the animal roamed
during life. Recent analysis of the strontium ratios in the strata of one Arctic woolly mammoth tusk in relation
to the geographic distribution of strontium ratios in the environment shows the animal’s range begin to
expand as it reached sexual maturity, only to contract again in its final 1.5 years.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined statement in the text as a whole?
A. It discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a
possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.
B. It illustrates a pattern of behavior among certain animals in order to present a theory about exceptions to
that pattern that is weakened by a finding described later in the text.
C. It describes a similarity in the behavior of certain animals in order to show why a method described later
in the text did not reveal whether another animal also showed that behavior.
D. It introduces a trait shared by certain animals in order to contextualize a hypothesis about the origin of
that trait that is advanced later in the text.

### Correct Answer: A
### Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as a
whole. The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixed
geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arctic
woolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (or
layers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding
range in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristic
shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data
described later in the text.
Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals of
staying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather,
the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice C
is incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency to
stay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed to
show whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tusk
showed that the mammoth’s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. Choice
D is incorrect. Though the underlined statement mentions a trait shared by a number of animals (their fixed geographic
range), the rest of the text does not present a hypothesis regarding the origin of that trait; rather, the researchers are
concerned with whether another particular animal shares that trait.

### Changes to vegetation cover and other human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, though
how deep these effects extend is unclear. Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to differences in
carbon and nitrogen levels that are not restricted to the topsoil layer (0–30 cm deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo
and colleagues sampled soils across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, cropland, forest) within each
of several Ethiopian locations. They found, though, that across land-use types, carbon and nitrogen
decreased to comparably low levels beyond depths of 30 cm.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?
A. It describes a phenomenon that scientists do not fully understand, explains a research team’s hypothesis
about that phenomenon, and then describes a finding that led the team to refine the hypothesis.
B. It introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that
question, and then describes an observation made by the team that conflicts with that hypothesis.
C. It discusses a process that scientists are somewhat unclear about, introduces competing hypotheses
about that process, and then explains how a research team concluded that one of those hypotheses is
likely correct.
D. It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientific debate, discusses how a research team
tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team collected that validate the hypothesis.

### Correct Answer: B
### Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by
explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil
remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which
is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed
below the topsoil layer—and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that
the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all
land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an
unresolved scientific question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an
observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and
nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the
phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice
C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents
a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it
doesn’t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo’s team was able to determine which hypothesis
was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate;
rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by
Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their
data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.

### The following text is adapted from Herman Melville’s 1855 novel Israel Potter. Israel is a young man
wandering through New England during the late eighteenth century.
He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acres
of land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land,
and there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it, Israel—who, however brave-hearted, and
even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of
his career, a singular patience and mildness—was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood
than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A. It implies that Israel treasures a particular characteristic of his personality when that characteristic should
usually be regarded as a flaw.
B. It suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted
in his ambition to establish a farm.
C. It shows why Israel would not have been able to undertake the enormous amount of labor necessary to
run a farm even if he had owned the necessary property.
D. It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others
would generally avoid.

### Correct Answer: B
### Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text
describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according
to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused to
fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find
another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, the
underlined portion states that though Israel was "brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch," he also
possessed "a singular patience and mildness." In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he
was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of.
Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily
thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.
Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not address
how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasional
courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a
farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be
courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that
he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not
explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature,
cheated of the property to which he had a right.

### The following text is from the 1924 poem “Cycle” by D’Arcy McNickle, who was a citizen of the Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes.
There shall be new roads wending,
A new beating of the drum—
Men’s eyes shall have fresh seeing,
Grey lives reprise their span—
But under the new sun’s being,
Completing what night began,
There’ll be the same backs bending,
The same sad feet shall drum—
When this night finds its ending
And day shall have come.....
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A. To consider how the repetitiveness inherent in human life can be both rewarding and challenging
B. To question whether activities completed at one time of day are more memorable than those completed
at another time of day
C. To refute the idea that joy is a more commonly experienced emotion than sadness is
D. To demonstrate how the experiences of individuals relate to the experiences of their communities

### Correct Answer: A
### Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by discussing the
promise of the future, with positive references to renewal such as “new roads,” “new beating of the drum,” and “fresh seeing.”
But with the “new sun,” the text continues, there will still be “the same backs bending” and “the same sad feet” drumming,
indicating that these difficulties will follow people into this new day. The poem thus considers both the rewards and
challenges associated with the repetitiveness of human life.
Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about how memorable activities are, let alone compare the
memorability of activities completed at different times of the day. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text contrasts hope
with difficulty, it does not compare the relative frequency of joyful feelings with that of sad feelings. Choice D is incorrect
because the text makes no distinction between the experiences of individuals and the experiences of their communities.

### In Jane Austen’s novel Mansfield Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford
causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware
of it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry’s mental state through his gestures, but also infers
that he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls
“deep intersubjectivity,” a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which
Austen’s novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. It states a claim about Austen’s skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by an
example presented in the following sentence.
B. It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from other
Austen novels cited in the following sentence.
C. It describes a recurring theme in Austen’s novels that is the focus of a literary scholar’s analysis
summarized in the following sentence.
D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in
the following sentence.

### Correct Answer: D
### Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers’ understanding of the
“deep intersubjectivity” described in the next sentence as central to Austen’s work.
Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen’s skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in the
following sentence. This choice essentially flips the paragraph: it’s this first sentence that provides an example. Choice B is
incorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn’t be the answer. Choice C is
incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t identify any “recurring theme,” but instead simply describes one interaction from
one book. This interaction exemplifies the literary technique of “deep intersubjectivity” that is introduced in the next
sentence.

### Astronomers are confident that the star Betelgeuse will eventually consume all the helium in its core and
explode in a supernova. They are much less confident, however, about when this will happen, since that
depends on internal characteristics of Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist Sarafina El-Badry
Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine
internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not sufficiently reveal Betelgeuse’s internal
characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be firmly fixed.
Which choice best describes the function of the second sentence in the overall structure of the text?
A. It describes a serious limitation of the method used by Nance and colleagues.
B. It presents the central finding reported by Nance and colleagues.
C. It identifies the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but did not.
D. It explains how the work of Nance and colleagues was received by others in the field.

### Correct Answer: C
### Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first
sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The
second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t
have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher
Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about
Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the
second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t.
Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve,
not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and
colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is
described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped
to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’
conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because
the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and
colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all.

### Generally it takes Tule geese about four days to migrate south for the winter. From their summer breeding
grounds in Cook Inlet, Alaska, the birds begin by flying over the Gulf of Alaska, keeping about 100 miles from
the Canadian shore. They pause to rest on the Pacific Ocean, then fly toward Summer Lake, Oregon, before
finally arriving at their winter destination of Sacramento Valley, California. In 2020, however, it took the geese
over twice as long to make their way from Cook Inlet to Sacramento Valley. According to researchers, the
reason was airborne pollutants.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A. It illustrates a change in Tule geese’s usual flight behavior.
B. It suggests an explanation for why Tule geese breed in Alaska.
C. It describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey.
D. It compares Tule geese to other birds that migrate south for the winter.

### Correct Answer: C
### Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best states how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first
sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the
underlined portion, the text describes the first part of that journey, which begins with the geese flying over the Gulf of Alaska
while keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese’s typical
journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it.
Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their
typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual flight behavior, the underlined portion doesn’t discuss this. Instead,
the underlined portion describes the first part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey over the Gulf of Alaska.
Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence containing the underlined portion mentions that Tule geese breed in Alaska, the
underlined portion doesn’t explain why the geese breed in that location. Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it’s
the starting point of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t
discuss any other birds that migrate south for the winter. In fact, the text is only concerned with the migration of Tule geese.

### The following text is adapted from Indian Boyhood, a 1902 memoir by Ohiyesa (Charles A. Eastman), a
Santee Dakota writer. In the text, Ohiyesa recalls how the women in his tribe harvested maple syrup during
his childhood.
Now the women began to test the trees—moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single
quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some
were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of the birchen basins
was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made. From the
corners of this chip—at first drop by drop, then more freely—the sap trickled into the little dishes.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. It portrays the range of personality traits displayed by the women as they work.
B. It foregrounds the beneficial relationship between humans and maple trees.
C. It demonstrates how human behavior can be influenced by the natural environment.
D. It elaborates on an aspect of the maple trees that the women evaluate.

### Correct Answer: D
### Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text’s overall portrayal
of how the women in Ohiyesa’s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple
trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap
described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so.
Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—
that the women are evaluating.
Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined
sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees,
which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined
sentence focuses on the trees’ willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and
the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the
trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in
turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the
influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave.

### The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John
is a child who lives in a town in the woods.
Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative
child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door.
On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees. On the bosom of the
stream float millions of delicately colored hyacinths. [John Redding] loved to wander down to the water’s
edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world
and [he] wanted to follow them.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. It provides an extended description of a location that John likes to visit.
B. It reveals that some residents of John’s town are confused by his behavior.
C. It illustrates the uniqueness of John’s imagination compared to the imaginations of other children.
D. It suggests that John longs to experience a larger life outside the Florida woods.

### Correct Answer: D
### Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
The text establishes that John has a strong imagination and then goes on to describe the St. John River near John’s home in
the Florida woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them
reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand
his life experiences beyond the Florida woods.
Choice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank
where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect
because the first sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the
underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence
elaborates on John’s imagination but doesn’t mention any other children to whom John could be compared.

### Jackie Ormes’s Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem (1937–38) was the first comic strip by a Black woman to
appear in a widely read newspaper. The strip tells the story of Torchy, a young woman who leaves Mississippi
to become a performer in New York City. Torchy’s story reflects the experience of the Great Migration (1910–
1970), when millions of Black Americans left the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United
States. Torchy Brown thus shows how Ormes used comics to comment humorously on issues affecting
Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A. To show how Ormes’s Torchy Brown inspired other Black women to write comic strips in the 1930s
B. To illustrate how the subjects Ormes addressed in her comic strips changed over the course of her career
C. To give an example of how Ormes presented the experiences of Black Americans in her comic strips
D. To claim that several characters in Torchy Brown were based on people that Ormes knew personally

### Correct Answer: C
## Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The text describes how Torchy Brown depicted the experiences of a young Black woman
experiencing America’s Great Migration. It further states that Ormes continued to use comics throughout her career to
humorously comment on important issues impacting Black Americans.
Choice A is incorrect. The text never mentions other Black women comic strip writers. Choice B is incorrect. The text never
mentions any changes in the subjects Ormes addressed. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions the inspiration for
characters in Torchy Brown.

Passage:
Since the turn of the twentieth century, urban planners have redesigned cities to include greater pedestrian accessibility, motivated by growing environmental concerns. Initially, educators and engineers assumed that crowding streets would worsen traffic congestion. However, subsequent observational studies demonstrated that when streets are reconfigured to prioritize pedestrian zones, traffic efficiency often improves. One central reinterpretation of these results is that the reallocation of road space reduces both vehicular volume and accidents, counterintuitively enhancing city accessibility. Thus, the evolution from traditional grid systems to pedestrian-friendly urban design represents not only a reaction to environmental imperatives but also an emerging acknowledgment of the benefits of constraining urban mobility.

Question:
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

A. It presents a chronological list of urban design innovations without linking them to a broader implication.
B. It contrasts differing expert opinions regarding urban congestion to argue that observational data is unreliable.
C. It outlines urban planning challenges by summarizing empirical findings, implicitly advocating for a return to traditional grid systems.
D. It introduces a longstanding urban planning challenge, describes initial assumptions and subsequent contradictory evidence, and concludes by synthesizing these elements into a revised understanding of urban accessibility.

Correct Answer: D

Rationale:
Option D is correct because the passage begins by presenting a historical challenge in urban planning, explains the initial assumption that crowding worsens traffic congestion, and then details how observational studies produced contradictory evidence. The final sentence synthesizes these points to show that shifts in design have benefited urban accessibility. 
• Option A is incorrect because it only notes a timeline without recognizing how the evidence and conclusion are integrated to form a new understanding. 
• Option B is incorrect since the passage does not question the reliability of observational data or present conflicting expert opinions. 
• Option C is incorrect as it misrepresents the concluding synthesis by suggesting an advocacy for traditional grid systems, which the text clearly does not support.

### What is wrong with this

While this example seems sophisticated on the surface, you need to ensure that your questions aren't predictable or so unambigous. In this example, the answer choice D is very obviously correct, and lacks any ambiguity. The distractors don't really distract in this example, because they are obviously correct, and the passage too directly corroborates the last answer- the passage begins by discussing an assumption that turned out to be wrong, and then explains that the converse of the assumption is true, which aligns very closely to the answer choice.

Contrast this to the following example:

##
The following text is adapted from Herman Melville’s 1857 novel The Confidence-Man. Humphry Davy was a prominent British chemist and inventor.

    Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcombical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant’s disdain; but, chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

    It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.

    It presents an account of a misunderstanding.

    It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.

    It explains why one character dislikes another.


    Correct Answer:

B
Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text tells a story of a first impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking guest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the guest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor.

Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the very end is the savant "thrown aback" by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davy—he’s not "embarrassed about his own behavior." Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. It doesn’t include the second half of the text, where the savant gets into a conversation with the man and then finds out that the man is Sir Humphry Davy.
Question Difficulty:

Hard

##

This is a better example of what to do, because it contains a higher level of ambiguity- In addition to the text beign a lot more dense and hard to read through, the answer choices A or D could feasibly be correct- the American savant could in fact be embarrassed by his behavior towards the famous chemist, and the last choice D could be implied if the American feels threatened by the chemist- This means that two of the answers are feasible and sound plausible, which is a contrast to the example of what not to do.
