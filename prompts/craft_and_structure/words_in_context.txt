Given a {difficulty} level (easy, medium, hard), generate a multiple-choice question that:

    Presents a short passage (3–5 sentences) with a blank or a highlighted word/phrase.
    Asks the student to select the word or phrase that most logically and precisely completes the text or matches the intended meaning in context.
    Provides four answer choices (A–D), only one of which is correct.
    Includes a rationale explaining why the correct answer is best and why the other choices are incorrect, referencing contextual clues.
    Ensures the vocabulary and context are appropriate for the specified {difficulty}.

Step-by-Step Formula

    Select a Passage Topic:
        Choose a topic suitable for the SAT (e.g., literature, history, science, social studies, arts).
        Ensure the passage is concise and contains enough context to infer the meaning or best word choice.

    Determine the Target Word/Phrase:
        For "completion" questions: Identify a key word or phrase that, when omitted, creates a logical gap in the passage.
        For "meaning" questions: Select a word or phrase in the passage that has multiple possible meanings or nuances.

    Construct the Passage:
        Write 1–3 sentences that provide sufficient context for the target word/phrase.
        Ensure the context subtly but clearly points toward the correct answer.

    Create Four Answer Choices:
        One correct answer that fits the context precisely.
        Three plausible distractors that are incorrect due to subtle contextual mismatches, misinterpretations, or less precise meanings.

    Adjust for {difficulty}:
        Easy: Use more common vocabulary and clear contextual clues.
        Medium: Use moderately challenging vocabulary and require more inference from context.
        Hard: Use sophisticated or nuanced vocabulary, subtle context, or words with multiple meanings.

    Write the Question Stem:
        For completion: "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?"
        For meaning: "As used in the text, what does the word/phrase '[target]' most nearly mean?"

    Provide the Correct Answer and Rationale:
        Clearly state the correct answer.
        Explain why it is correct, referencing specific context.
        Briefly explain why each distractor is incorrect.

    Format the Output:
        Present the passage, question, answer choices, correct answer, and rationale in a clear, SAT-like format.

"For a 2020 exhibition, photographer and neurobiologist Okunola Jeyifous ______ a series of new images
based on a series of alphabet posters from the 1970s known as the “Black ABCs,” which featured Black
children from Chicago. Jeyifous photographed the now-adult models and layered the photos over magnified
images of the models’ cells, resulting in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.”
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. validated
B. created
C. challenged
D. restored

### Correct Answer: B
### Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of Jeyifous’s series of
images for the 2020 exhibition. In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer
and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those
photographs with magnified images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro
portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the
images for display in the exhibition.
Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “validated,” or corroborated, the series of
images. The text describes Jeyifous’s process for composing the images but doesn’t describe Jeyifous making an effort to
evaluate the images for their artistic or scientific legitimacy. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to
suggest that Jeyifous “challenged,” or disputed, an aspect of the images; rather, the focus of the text is on the inspiration
behind the images and the method Jeyifous used to achieve them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that
Jeyifous made the images himself using a combination of photography and magnified pictures of cells, not that he
“restored,” or reconditioned, the images from a deteriorated state.

"In the mid-nineteenth century, some abolitionist newspapers ______ westward migration in the United States;
by printing a letter that described the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California during
the Gold Rush, Frederick Douglass’s newspaper North Star was one such publication that inspired readers to
relocate.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. stimulated
B. assigned
C. opposed
D. disregarded

### Correct Answer: A
### Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. "Stimulated" means "encouraged interest or increased activity in." Because the newspapers
discussed the benefits of westward migration and "inspired readers to relocate," we can infer that they encouraged people to
move west.
Choice B is incorrect. "Assigned" means "gave a job or duty." Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move
west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. "Opposed" means "disapproved of." We can tell that this isn’t the
case, because the newspapers discussed "the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California" and "inspired
readers to relocate." Choice D is incorrect. "Disregarded" means "ignored." If the newspapers are writing about the west and
"inspir[ing] readers to relocate," they can’t be ignoring it at the same time.

"The following text is from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel The Great Gatsby.
[Jay Gatsby] was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement
that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even
more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking
through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.
As used in the text, what does the word “quality” most nearly mean?
A. Standard
B. Prestige
C. Characteristic
D. Accomplishment

### Correct Answer: C
### Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. “This quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a
characteristic or trait of his.
Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness
of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Standard” is a synonym for a different definition of
“quality”: the degree of excellence of something. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here,
“this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his.
“Prestige” would suggest a high status or an admirable reputation, which doesn’t match that description. Choice D is
incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of
movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Accomplishment” would suggest an achievement, which
doesn’t match that description.

"Though not closely related, the hedgehog tenrecs of Madagascar share basic ______ true hedgehogs,
including protective spines, pointed snouts, and small body size—traits the two groups of mammals
independently developed in response to equivalent roles in their respective habitats.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. examples of
B. concerns about
C. indications of
D. similarities with

### Correct Answer: D
### Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing "similarities with" means having some resemblance to. The text
establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren’t closely related, hedgehog
tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent
development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share
basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are "examples of," or representative of, true
hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren’t closely related;
therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "concerns
about" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and
true hedgehogs share. There’s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs,
or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "indications of" would mean evidence
of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the
two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group
of mammals wouldn’t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.

"The work of Kiowa painter T.C. Cannon derives its power in part from the tension among his ______
influences: classic European portraiture, with its realistic treatment of faces; the American pop art
movement, with its vivid colors; and flatstyle, the intertribal painting style that rejects the effect of depth
typically achieved through shading and perspective.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. complementary
B. unknown
C. disparate
D. interchangeable

### Correct Answer: C
### Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the artistic styles that have
influenced Cannon’s work. As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension
exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic
European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading
and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work are disparate.
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s artwork, so it
wouldn’t make sense to say that the influences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one
another’s deficiencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s influences as
“unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the influences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect
because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s work, not that they are
“interchangeable,” or capable of being used in one another’s place.

"Barring major archaeological discoveries, we are unlikely to ever have ______ account of ancient Egypt under
the female pharaoh Hatshepsut, as much of the evidence of her reign was deliberately destroyed by her
successors.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. an imaginative
B. a superficial
C. an exhaustive
D. a questionable

### Correct Answer: C
### Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of historical evidence about ancient
Egypt under the reign of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. In this context, "an exhaustive" account would be a thorough one. The text
states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed—in other words, there is a lack of surviving
records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of
Hatshepsut’s reign is unlikely.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "an imaginative" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas
and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was deliberately
destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not
strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "a superficial" account would be one that is lacking in depth or
concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was purposely destroyed,
which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available
to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it
more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because "a questionable" account would be one likely to
be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign has survived, accounts of
that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest
that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable.
