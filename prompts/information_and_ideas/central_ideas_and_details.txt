Step 1: Select a Topic and Define the Core Task

    Choose a Topic: Select a topic from a wide range of subjects, including literature, science, history, social studies, or the arts. The text should be self-contained.

        For Easy/Medium difficulty: Choose a straightforward topic (e.g., an animal's behavior, a historical event, a description of an artist's technique).

        For Hard difficulty: Choose a more complex or abstract topic (e.g., a debate within an academic field, an interpretation of a philosophical concept, analysis of figurative language in a poem).

    Define the Core Task & Question Type: Decide what the student must do. This choice directly controls the question's difficulty.

        (Easy) Locate a Detail: The question asks for a specific piece of information explicitly stated in the text. The student simply has to find the relevant sentence.

            Stem: "According to the text, what/why/how...?"

        (Medium) Identify the Main Idea/Purpose: The question asks for the primary point or purpose of the entire paragraph. The student must read the whole text and synthesize its message.

            Stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?" or "Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?"

        (Hard) Infer from Details/State a Complex Main Idea: The question asks for a conclusion that is not explicitly stated but is logically required by the details provided. Alternatively, it asks for the main idea of a text that presents a nuanced, multi-part, or revisionist argument.

            Stem: "What does the text most strongly suggest about...?" or "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?"

Step 2: Write the Text

    Draft the Text: Write a short passage (4-10 sentences). The style and complexity of the text must match the intended difficulty.

        For an Easy question, use clear, declarative sentences. The key detail should be in a single, easy-to-find sentence.

        For a Medium question, structure the text with a clear topic sentence and supporting details that all point toward a single main idea. The text should have a logical flow.

        For a Hard question, use more complex syntax and advanced vocabulary. Introduce nuance with words like "putatively," "however," "largely," or "contingent." For literary passages, use figurative language (metaphor, personification) that requires interpretation. The argument should be dense, requiring the reader to connect multiple complex ideas to form the main point.

Step 3: Formulate the Question Stem

    Write the Stem: Based on the Core Task you defined in Step 1, write a clear question. Ensure it precisely targets the intended skill. For example, if you wrote a text about how researchers did something, ask, "According to the text, how did the researchers...?"

Step 4: Craft the Answer Choices

This is the most critical step for creating a valid and challenging question.

    Write the Correct Answer (Key):

        The correct answer must be unambiguously supported by the text.

        For detail questions, it should be a close paraphrase of the explicit information.

        For main idea questions, it must accurately summarize the entire text, not just one part.

        For inference questions, it must be a necessary logical conclusion from the provided information.

    Write Three Plausible Distractors: Design distractors that tempt students but are demonstrably wrong. The quality of the distractors determines the question's difficulty.

        Distractor Type 1: The Out-of-Scope: A statement that is plausible or related to the topic but is not mentioned in the text at all. (Effective for Easy/Medium questions).

        Distractor Type 2: The Detail-as-Main-Idea: A statement that is true according to the text but represents a minor, supporting detail rather than the central idea. (Effective for Medium/Hard main idea questions).

        Distractor Type 3: The Mischaracterization/Subtle Twist: A statement that uses words or concepts from the text but twists their meaning, relationship, or scope. This is the most effective distractor for Hard questions. Examples:

            Confusing cause with effect.

            Taking a conditional statement ("may provide") and making it absolute ("proves").

            Misinterpreting figurative language literally.

            Slightly altering a key detail (e.g., text says "northern regions," distractor says "South America overall").

Step 5: Write the Rationale

    Rationale for the Correct Answer: Briefly explain why this option is the best choice, pointing to the specific sentence(s) or logic that supports it.

    Rationale for Incorrect Answers: For each distractor, explain its specific flaw using the terminology from Step 4 (e.g., "This choice is incorrect because it describes a supporting detail, not the main idea," or "This choice mischaracterizes the author's conclusion as absolute when the text presents it as conditional.").

The following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo’s 2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl
Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura are
her brother and sister.
Mario and I played games to see how many different license plates we could spot, and Laura liked to
look for children in the back seats of the cars we passed. We were used to the forty-five-minute drive to
El Paso and familiar with the six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered what the long journey to Mexico
City would be like.
©2018 by Sylvia Acevedo
According to the text, what did the narrator and Mario do while riding in the car?
A. They read books.
B. They sang songs.
C. They went to sleep.
D. They played games.

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes what the narrator and Mario did while riding in the car. The
text describes a car trip that the narrator is taking with her family. The text states that during the car ride, the narrator and
Mario "played games" to see how many different license plates they could spot.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the narrator and Mario reading during the car ride and instead
describes them playing games. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the narrator and Mario singing songs
during the car ride and instead describes them playing games. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the
narrator and Mario sleeping during the car ride and instead describes them playing games.

The recovery of a 1,000-year-old Chinese shipwreck in the Java Sea near present-day Indonesia has yielded a
treasure trove of artifacts, including thousands of small ceramic bowls. Using a portable X-ray fluorescence
analyzer tool, Lisa Niziolek and her team were able to detect the chemical composition of these bowls
without damaging them. By comparing the chemical signatures of the bowls with those of the materials still
at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese kilns likely produced the ceramic
bowls.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Because of a new technology, researchers can locate and recover more shipwrecks than they could in the
past.
B. Researchers have been able to identify the location of a number of Chinese kilns in operation 1,000 years
ago.
C. With the help of a special tool, researchers have determined the likely origin of bowls recovered from a
shipwreck.
D. Before the invention of portable X-ray fluorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an
artifact to analyze its components.

Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, which he
putatively used to illustrate a robust model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their
own economic interests. Note “putatively”: as Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this metaphor only
once in his economic writings—to make a narrow point about the then-dominant economic theory of
mercantilism—and it was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists eager to secure an
intellectual pedigree for their views elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored until
economists in the twentieth century came to realize that the metaphor was a robust model that
anticipated their own views.
B. Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it does not
have in Smith’s work, but it is nevertheless a useful model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits
by pursuing their own economic interests.
C. Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand has been interpreted as a model of how individuals acting in their
own interest produce aggregate benefits, but it was intended as a subtle critique of the economic theory
of mercantilism.
D. The reputation of Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand is not due to the importance of the metaphor in
Smith’s work but rather to the promotion of the metaphor by some later economists for their own ends

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist
Adam Smith’s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to
illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests
can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by
calling out the term "putatively," and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his
works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that
the metaphor didn’t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical
framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing
"putatively," the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor’s use
outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so
to support their own views without regard for the metaphor’s importance to Smith’s work.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith’s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century
economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith’s metaphor to self-
servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this
choice fails to reflect the text’s emphasis on Smith’s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although
the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith’s metaphor, the text doesn’t
suggest that the metaphor is a "useful model" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals’ selfish actions, let alone that
this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text
indicates that Smith’s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate
benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are
subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith’s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-
century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith
would agree with their economic views.

To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocuts. In linocut printing,
an artist carves an image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In
the linocut series The Black Woman (1946–1947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women
alongside the achievements of well-known Black women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections
among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience and supported her
aim to unite Black women through her art.
According to the text, what is significant about Catlett’s use of linocut printing?
A. Linocut printing involved using materials that were readily available to Catlett.
B. Linocut printing helped Catlett use art to connect people, especially Black women.
C. Catlett became commercially successful once she started using linocut printing.
D. Catlett was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing.

Correct Answer: B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. The last sentence states that the linocut process “supported her [Catlett’s] aim to unite Black
women through her art.”
Choice A is incorrect. The text briefly describes the linocut printing process but doesn’t discuss the availability of the
materials used in the process. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the linocut process “enabled Catlett’s work to reach a
wide audience,” but that doesn’t mean that linocuts made her “commercially successful.” In other words, we don’t know how
much money she made off her linocuts—we only know that more people were able to see her work. Choice D is incorrect.
The text says that Catlett depicted Black women in her linocuts, but not that she was one of the first Black artists to use
linocut printing.

Cats can judge unseen people’s positions in space by the sound of their voices and thus react with surprise
when the same person calls to them from two different locations in a short span of time. Saho Takagi and
colleagues reached this conclusion by measuring cats’ levels of surprise based on their ear and head
movements while the cats heard recordings of their owners’ voices from two speakers spaced far apart. Cats
exhibited a low level of surprise when owners’ voices were played twice from the same speaker, but they
showed a high level of surprise when the voice was played once each from the two different speakers.
According to the text, how did the researchers determine the level of surprise displayed by the cats in the
study?
A. They watched how each cat moved its ears and head.
B. They examined how each cat reacted to the voice of a stranger.
C. They studied how each cat physically interacted with its owner.
D. They tracked how each cat moved around the room.

Correct Answer: A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it explains how the researchers determined the level of surprise displayed by the cats in
the study. The text states that Saho Takagi and colleagues played recordings of the voice of each cat’s owner and measured
how surprised the cat was by the recording based on how it moved its ears and head.
Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, the recordings played for each cat in the study were of the voice of the
cat’s owner, not a stranger’s voice. Choice C is incorrect because the text explains that during the study, the cats didn’t
interact directly with their owners; instead, the cats listened to recordings of their owners’ voices. Choice D is incorrect
because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers monitored the cats’ movement around the room in which the study
was conducted.

Paleontologist Lucas E. Fiorelli and colleagues have reported the discovery at a mine in Brazil of several egg
clutches, partially preserved single eggs, and egg shells from the Late Cretaceous period. The researchers
have concluded that the area was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs, a group of sauropod
dinosaurs. The finding is significant given the previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of
South America, which led many paleontologists to assume that titanosaurs migrated south to lay eggs.
What does the text most strongly suggest about the site discovered by the researchers?
A. It is the earliest known example of a titanosaur nesting and breeding site.
B. It was very difficult to excavate given that it was discovered in a mine.
C. It may have been occupied by other sauropods in addition to titanosaurs.
D. It is farther north than any other nesting site discovered in South America.

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about the site discovered by the researchers that is supported
by the text. The text discusses Fiorelli and colleagues’ discovery of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Brazilian
mine. According to the text, the presence of these eggs, which are from the Late Cretaceous period, led the researchers to
conclude that the location was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the finding is
important because of the “previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.” If there haven’t been
any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America’s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the first, then
the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest
titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it’s the first nesting site found in northern
regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn’t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with
that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites. Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any
difficulties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian
mine. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine
was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs. The text simply mentions that titanosaurs are sauropod dinosaurs and
presents the researchers’ conclusion that the site they discovered was for titanosaurs.

Scent is tightly interwoven with our daily lives, often evoking significant memories and important social
events. This connection is of growing interest to archaeologists who hope to use it to better understand
ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine. Although the speed at which odor molecules dissipate
makes identifying ancient scents challenging, advancements in biomolecular technologies show promise in
unlocking ancient aromas from preserved artifacts. Archaeological studies making use of these
advancements may provide new insights into past societies.
According to the text, what is one reason some archaeologists are interested in recovering scents from
ancient artifacts?
A. They are investigating whether people’s sense of smell has declined in recent centuries.
B. They believe the scents could illuminate important aspects of ancient life.
C. They think that ancient scents would be enjoyable to people today.
D. They hope to develop new medicines using ancient scent molecules.

Correct Answer: B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. The text states that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient
rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine," all of which are important aspects of ancient life.
Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t say anything about investigating if people’s sense of smell has declined in recent
centuries. It says that scents fade over time—not that people have gotten worse at smelling scents. Choice C is incorrect.
The text says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social
hierarchies, and medicine," but it doesn’t say anything about ancient scents being enjoyable to people today. Choice D is
incorrect. The text doesn’t say anything about developing new medicines. Rather, it says that archaeologists are interested in
using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine."

A contraction of “you all,” the pronoun “y’all” has long been used as a plural version of “you” in the South and
in Black communities around the US. In recent decades, most other English-speaking communities in the US
have begun to use “y’all.” What explains its rise in popularity? Many varieties of English have no pronoun that
specifically addresses more than one person and instead must use “you” to address both one person and
more than one. But “y’all” always refers to two or more people. As a result, it conveys the speaker’s meaning
more precisely than “you” can.
Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?
A. How many other plural versions of the pronoun “you” are there in English, besides “y’all”?
B. Why has the pronoun “y’all” become more widely used in the US?
C. When was the first recorded use of the pronoun “y’all” in the English language?
D. Is “y’all” commonly used in English-speaking regions of the world besides the US?

Correct Answer: B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a question that the text is attempting to answer: why has the pronoun "y’all"
become more widely used in the US? The text begins by explaining where and how the plural pronoun "y’all" originated and
then goes on to state that its use has been rising in popularity, even in areas outside of its place of origin. The text then
attributes this rise in popularity to the fact that many varieties of English do not have a pronoun to address more than one
person, and thus "you" must function as both a singular and plural pronoun.
Choice A is incorrect because while the text states that "y’all" is used as a plural of "you" in English, it does not discuss other
plural forms of the word. Choice C is incorrect because while the text discusses the general origins of the pronoun "y’all," it
does not state when the use of the pronoun was first recorded in the English language. Choice D is incorrect because though
the text addresses the use of the pronoun "y’all" within English-speaking communities in the US, it does not address its use
outside of that geographic area.

The following text is from Maggie Pogue Johnson’s 1910 poem “Poet of Our Race.” In this poem, the speaker
is addressing Paul Laurence Dunbar, a Black author.
Thou, with stroke of mighty pen,
Hast told of joy and mirth,
And read the hearts and souls of men
As cradled from their birth.
The language of the flowers,
Thou hast read them all,
And e’en the little brook
Responded to thy call.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A. To praise a certain writer for being especially perceptive regarding people and nature
B. To establish that a certain writer has read extensively about a variety of topics
C. To call attention to a certain writer’s careful and elaborately detailed writing process
D. To recount fond memories of an afternoon spent in nature with a certain writer

Correct Answer: A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. In the first part of the text, the
speaker addresses Paul Laurence Dunbar’s ability to understand people (he has “read the hearts and souls of men” and
written of their “joy and mirth”). In the second part of the text, the speaker describes Dunbar’s thorough understanding of the
natural world (he has read “the language of the flowers” and engaged with “the little brook”). Thus, the text mainly praises
Dunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature.
Choice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the “hearts and souls of men” and the “language
of flowers” to convey Dunbar’s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of
these things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect because the text notes how well Dunbar has made
sense of the topics he’s written about but doesn’t address any specific parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond the
suggestion that he used a pen. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on Dunbar’s understanding of people and
nature as expressed in his writing. Nothing in the text suggests that the speaker is recalling a particular afternoon actually
spent in nature with Dunbar; even if there had been a shared experience, the text isn’t focused on reminiscing.
