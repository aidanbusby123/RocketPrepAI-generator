Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test foundational skills like basic modeling, interpreting simple equations, or applying core geometric properties of lines.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Direct Modeling: Create a word problem where two items with different constant values sum to a total. The student must select the correct equation in the form ax + by = c.

    B. Basic Word Problem: Create a word problem that can be solved with a simple linear equation in two variables, where one variable's value is given.

    C. Parallel/Perpendicular Lines (Slope-Intercept Form): Give the equation of a line in y = mx + b form. Ask for the slope of a line that is parallel or perpendicular to it.

    D. Graph-to-Table Matching: Show a simple graph of a line with clear integer intercepts and ask the student to select the table of values that matches the graph.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Use simple integers and clear, unambiguous language.

    Present equations in straightforward forms.

    Distractors should represent common errors: swapping coefficients (ax+by vs. bx+ay), confusing parallel and perpendicular slope rules, or misreading points from a graph.

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test multi-step procedural problems or interpretation of equations in more complex contexts.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Interpret Coefficients in Context: Give an equation in standard form (ax + by = c) representing a real-world scenario (e.g., perimeter, cost). Ask for the best interpretation of a coefficient (a or b).

    B. Find the Equation from Two Points: Give two coordinate points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and ask for the equation of the line that passes through them.

    C. Algebraic Manipulation to Find Slope: Give an equation not in slope-intercept form (e.g., with parentheses that need to be distributed) and ask for the slope.

    D. Modeling a Geometric Scenario: Describe a situation involving the perimeters of multiple shapes and ask the student to formulate the equation that represents the total perimeter.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    The problem will require two or three distinct logical steps (e.g., find perimeter of one shape, then another, then sum them).

    Equations may involve fractions or require simplification before key features can be identified.

    Distractors should represent plausible errors in calculation (e.g., slope formula errors) or modeling (e.g., confusing area with perimeter).

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test the synthesis of multiple algebraic concepts, abstract reasoning, and complex modeling.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Multi-Step Transformation and Analysis: Give a line (via table, graph, or equation). State that it is transformed (e.g., translated vertically or horizontally). The student must then find a key feature (e.g., the x-intercept) of the new, transformed line.

    B. Abstract Properties of Perpendicular Lines: Give a pair of perpendicular lines with unknown constants (e.g., ax + by = 1). Ask the student to identify another pair of lines from the options that must also be perpendicular, based on the abstract relationship between a and b.

    C. Interpret and Calculate from Coefficients: Give an equation in standard form (ax + by = c) representing a real-world scenario. The question requires the student to first interpret the meaning of the coefficients a and b and then perform a calculation based on that interpretation (e.g., find b - a).

    D. Find Intercepts and Calculate a Ratio: Give an equation in standard form. Ask the student to find the x-intercept (a, 0) and y-intercept (0, b), and then compute a value based on them, such as their ratio a/b.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Problems should have multiple layers. The initial information is used to find intermediate values, which are then used in a final step.

    The format can be algebraic, graphical, or tabular, but the cognitive load should be high.

    Distractors must be sophisticated, representing common conceptual errors (e.g., confusing the x- and y-intercepts, making a sign error in the slope relationship) or misinterpretations of the required transformation. Student-produced response formats are particularly effective for this level.
