Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test foundational skills: evaluating a function, interpreting parameters in a simple context, or finding an equation from basic information.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Interpret a Parameter: Given a linear function f(x) = mx + b in a word problem context, ask for the real-world meaning of m (the rate) or b (the initial value/y-intercept).

    B. Evaluate the Function: Given a function f(x) = mx + b and a specific input value for x, ask for the output value. This can be presented as a word problem.

    C. Model a Simple Scenario: Provide a simple real-world scenario with a constant rate and a fixed fee/starting amount. Ask the student to select the correct function f(x) = mx + b that models it.

    D. Find an Equation from the y-intercept and a Point: Give the value of f(0) and f(1) and ask for the equation of the function f.

    E. Identify a Feature on a Graph: Show a graph of a line and ask the student to identify a key feature like the x-intercept, y-intercept, or slope.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Keep numbers simple (integers or easy fractions).

    Use clear, unambiguous language in word problems.

    For interpretation questions, ensure the distractors misinterpret the roles of slope and intercept.

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test multi-step procedural problems that combine function concepts with algebraic manipulation.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Find an Unknown Constant: Provide a linear function with an unknown constant (e.g., f(x) = mx - 28) and a table of values. The student must use one (x,y) pair to solve for m.

    B. Solve for the Input: Provide a function (e.g., f(x) = 2x + 5) and ask for the value of x for which f(x) equals a certain number. This often involves solving an equation with fractions.

    C. Create an Equation from Slope and a Point: Verbally describe the slope (e.g., "For every increase in x by 1, y increases by 8") and provide one (x,y) pair. The student must find the full equation.

    D. Function Transformations: Provide the graph of a transformed function, such as y = f(x) + k, and ask for the equation of the original function f(x).

    E. Operations on Functions: Define two functions, f(x) and g(x), and ask the student to compute a value like k * f(a) + j * g(a).

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Problems will require at least two distinct logical steps (e.g., find slope, then find intercept; evaluate two functions, then combine).

    Use a mix of presentation formats: table, graph, algebraic, verbal.

    Student-produced response (grid-in) questions are effective here.

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test complex modeling from verbal descriptions or abstract understanding of linear function properties.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Complex Modeling with (x-k): Create a word problem involving a fixed initial cost for a certain duration (e.g., "first day," "first two hours") and an additional charge for each additional unit of time. The correct model will involve a term like Rate * (x - k).

    B. Conceptual Interpretation of Intercepts and Slope: Verbally describe a linear function. Ask for the best interpretation of a specific parameter (e.g., the x-intercept). The distractors must be plausible but incorrect interpretations of other parameters (the y-intercept and the slope).

    C. System of Equations from a Table: Provide a table of values for a linear function f(x) = ax + b. Ask for the value of an expression involving a and b (e.g., a - b). This requires using two points from the table to create a system of two linear equations and solving for a and b.

    D. Rate of Change Application: Give a linear function that models a real-world conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit). Ask for the change in the output variable given a specific change in the input variable. This purely tests the understanding of slope as a multiplier for the change in x.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Word problems should have nuanced language that requires careful parsing.

    The required algebra may be simple, but the setup is complex.

    The question often asks for something other than a direct calculation (e.g., asks for an equation, an interpretation, or the value of an expression like a - b).

    Distractors should represent common misinterpretations of the setup (e.g., for Scenario A, modeling the cost as Rate * x instead of Rate * (x-k)).
