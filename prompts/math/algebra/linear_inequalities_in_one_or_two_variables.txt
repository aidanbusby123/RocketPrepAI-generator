Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test the direct translation of simple scenarios into algebraic inequalities or the basic interpretation of a graphed inequality.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Model a Simple Word Problem: A verbal description of a situation involving a constraint (e.g., "at least," "at most," "under," "no more than"). The student must select the correct inequality.

    B. Model a Range: A verbal description of a minimum and maximum value for a variable. The student must select the correct compound inequality.

    C. Identify Inequality from Graph: Show a graph of a shaded region with a clear boundary line (integer slope and y-intercept). Ask the student to identify the corresponding inequality.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Use clear, unambiguous keywords (at least -> ≥, under -> <).

    Keep the algebraic expressions simple (x + a ≥ b or ax + by < c).

    Distractors should test common errors: reversing the inequality sign, mixing up coefficients, or choosing the wrong y-intercept from the graph.

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test the ability to model slightly more complex scenarios or to identify solutions to a given inequality.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Model with a Preliminary Step: The word problem requires a simple calculation before the inequality can be set up (e.g., calculating remaining capacity or budget).

    B. Model and Solve: The student must set up a one-variable inequality from a word problem and then solve for the variable. The answer may require interpretation (e.g., finding the maximum integer solution).

    C. Identify a Solution Point on a Graph: Show a graph of a shaded region and provide four (x, y) coordinate pairs as options. The student must identify the one point that lies in the solution area.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    The context requires two logical steps to solve.

    The language might be slightly more abstract ("the minimum value of x is...").

    Distractors should represent plausible misinterpretations of the problem's setup or calculation errors during solving.

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test the ability to model complex, multi-layered scenarios or to verify solutions for a given inequality.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Complex Modeling: The word problem involves multiple interacting variables and constraints, often including percentages or other embedded calculations, leading to a complex inequality (e.g., Lower_Bound ≤ expression ≤ Upper_Bound).

    B. Test Solutions from a Table: Provide an inequality and multiple tables of (x, y) values. The student must identify the one table where all pairs are solutions. This requires systematically testing multiple points.

    C. Solve a System of Inequalities: Provide a system of two linear inequalities and ask which of the given points is a solution. This requires checking the point in both inequalities.

    D. Model and Solve a Complex Verbal Inequality: Provide a complex verbal statement (e.g., "A number x is at most k less than n times the value of y"), give a value for one variable, and ask for the maximum/minimum possible value of the other.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Word problems should contain nuanced language that can be easily misinterpreted (e.g., confusing total sales with total earnings).

    The task often involves tedious but precise work, such as testing 9-12 points in the table-based questions.

    Distractors for table-based questions should be tables where one or two points fail the inequality, making them very tempting.

    Student-produced response formats are particularly effective for solving questions.
