Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test basic, procedural fluency in solving simple systems of equations or reading a solution from a graph.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Solve by Substitution: Provide a system where one equation is already solved for a variable (e.g., x = 5 or y = 2x + 1).

    B. Solve by Simple Elimination: Provide a system where the coefficients of one variable are already opposites (e.g., 3x + 2y = 8 and -3x + 5y = 6).

    C. Graphical Solution: Provide a graph showing two intersecting lines with a clear integer intersection point. Ask for the solution (x, y).

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Use simple integer coefficients and solutions.

    The question should directly ask for the value of x, y, or the solution point (x, y).

    Distractors should include common errors like finding the value of the wrong variable, sign errors, or misreading the graph's axes.

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test the standard methods of solving systems that require one preparatory step, or to model a common word problem.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Solve by Elimination with Multiplication: Provide a system where one equation must be multiplied by a constant to allow for elimination.

    B. Solve for an Expression: Provide a system that is set up to easily solve for an expression (e.g., 13x) rather than for x or y individually.

    C. Model a Word Problem: Create a word problem involving two different items with two different totals (e.g., total distance and total time; total cost for two different stores). The task is to identify the correct system of equations.

    D. Conceptual (Infinite Solutions): Give one linear equation and ask the student to identify which of the options would create a system with infinitely many solutions.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    The problem will require a clear strategy (e.g., "I should multiply the second equation by -2") or a translation from a verbal description.

    The question can ask for x, y, an expression, or the system itself.

    Distractors for modeling questions should represent common setup errors (e.g., swapping coefficients, mixing up the totals).

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test deep conceptual understanding of systems or to require the synthesis of multiple algebraic and geometric concepts.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Conceptual (No Solution): Give a system with an unknown constant t. The student must find the value of t that results in the system having no solution. This requires setting the slopes equal to each other while ensuring the y-intercepts are different. The equations may first need to be rearranged into slope-intercept form.

    B. Conceptual (Number of Solutions): Give a system where the equations look different but are either parallel (no solution) or equivalent (infinite solutions). The student must first manipulate the equations and then determine the number of solutions.

    C. Multi-step Modeling and Solving: Create a complex word problem that requires the student to both set up the system of two equations and then solve it for one of the variables.

    D. Synthesizing Graphical and Algebraic Information: Provide the graph of a two-line system. Then, provide a third linear equation. The question asks for the number of solutions to the new three-equation system. This requires the student to first find the solution (x, y) from the graph and then test whether that point satisfies the third equation.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    Problems often have multiple layers of logic. The setup should be complex enough that the solution path is not immediately obvious.

    Use a mix of student-produced response and multiple-choice formats.

    Distractors must be sophisticated, targeting common conceptual misunderstandings, such as the conditions for no solution vs. infinite solutions, or errors in multi-step calculations.
