Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test for basic procedural fluency in solving two-step linear equations or modeling very simple real-world scenarios.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Procedural Solve: A straightforward two-step equation in the form ax + b = c.

    B. Simple Word Problem: A real-world scenario where the initial amount, rate of change, and final amount are given explicitly. The student must set up and solve the corresponding two-step equation.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    For Scenario A: Write the equation ax + b = c. Choose integers for a, b, and c such that the solution for x is also an integer.

    For Scenario B: Write a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) describing a situation (e.g., managing inventory, saving money, distance traveled). Clearly state all necessary values.

    Question Stem: "What value of p satisfies the equation...?" or "Based on the estimate, in how many days will..."

Step 3: Create Answer Choices

    Correct Answer: The correct integer solution to the equation.

    Distractors:

        The result of a common calculation error (e.g., adding instead of subtracting b, or making a sign error).

        A value from the problem itself (e.g., the rate or the initial value).

        The result of incorrectly setting up the equation (e.g., Initial + Rate*Time = Final instead of Initial - Rate*Time = Final).

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test the student's ability to recognize and exploit algebraic structure to find an efficient solution path.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Solve for an Expression: Create an equation where the same linear expression (e.g., ax + b) appears on both sides of the equals sign. The question must ask for the value of the expression, not the variable x.

    B. Factorable Equation: Create an equation where a common binomial factor (e.g., x + c) appears in multiple terms, often with fractional or different integer coefficients. This structure allows for factoring as a shortcut.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    For Scenario A: The equation should be in a form like k(ax+b) + m = n(ax+b) + p.

    For Scenario B: The equation should be in a form like k(x+c) + m(x+c) = p.

    Question Stem: "If [equation], what is the value of ax + b?" or "What value of x is the solution to the given equation?" (This can be multiple-choice or free-response).

Step 3: Create Answer Choices (if multiple-choice)

    Correct Answer: The correct value.

    Distractors:

        For Scenario A, one distractor must be the value of x itself, to catch students who solve the long way and forget the final step.

        Results from sign errors or distribution errors.

        An answer that incorrectly simplifies the structure (e.g., just canceling out the common expression).

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test higher-order thinking by requiring either complex algebraic modeling or deep conceptual understanding of equations.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Complex Algebraic Modeling: Design a word problem with multiple interacting parts and variables. The task is not to solve, but to construct the correct equation that models the situation.

    B. Number of Solutions: Create a linear equation that, upon simplification, results in x = 0 (one solution), a true statement like a = a (infinitely many solutions), or a false statement like a = b (no solution). The question asks how many solutions the equation has.

Step 2: Construct the Question

    For Scenario A: Write a detailed word problem (3-4 sentences) involving at least three different quantities, where one quantity is defined in terms of another (e.g., "The number of red marbles is 5 times the number of blue marbles, n"). The context can be geometric, financial, etc.

    For Scenario B: Write a simple-looking linear equation, but choose the coefficients so it simplifies to one of the three conceptual outcomes.

    Question Stem: "Which equation must be true for the value of n?" or "How many solutions does the given equation have?"

Step 3: Create Answer Choices

    Correct Answer: The correct equation or number of solutions.

    Distractors:

        For Scenario A, create equations that represent common modeling errors:

            Confusing two different quantities (e.g., using side length where number of sides is required).

            Setting the wrong quantities equal (e.g., modeling the perimeter but setting it equal to the number of sides).

            Omitting one of the components from the total.

        For Scenario B, the distractors will be the other possible answers for the number of solutions (Zero, Exactly one, Exactly two, Infinitely many).
