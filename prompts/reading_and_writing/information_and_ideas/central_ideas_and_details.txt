Step 1: Define the Core Task and Difficulty Level

First, choose one of the following core tasks for the student. This decision will guide the creation of the text, question, and answer choices.

    (Easy) Locate an Explicit Detail: The student must find a specific piece of information that is directly stated in the text.

        Text should be: A straightforward informational or narrative passage. The answer is located in a single, clear sentence.

        Question Stem: "According to the text, what/why/how...?" or "Based on the text, how did [character] most likely feel...?"

    (Medium) Identify the Main Idea or Main Purpose: The student must read the entire text and synthesize its key points to determine its primary message or function.

        Text should be: A well-organized paragraph with a clear logical structure (e.g., a claim followed by supporting evidence, a description of a scientific finding, an explanation of a phenomenon).

        Question Stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?" or "Which choice best describes [subject]'s approach to art, as presented in the text?" or "Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?"

    (Hard) Infer a Conclusion or Identify a Complex/Nuanced Main Idea: The student must either (a) draw a logical conclusion that is strongly implied but not explicitly stated, or (b) state the main idea of a text that presents a complex, abstract, or revisionist argument.

        Text should be: Densely worded, using complex syntax and vocabulary (e.g., "putatively," "contingent," "by the way"). It might involve comparing two viewpoints, analyzing a hypothetical scenario, interpreting figurative language in a literary text, or challenging a common assumption.

        Question Stem: "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?" or "What does the text most strongly suggest about...?" or "Based on the text, what challenge do humans sometimes experience?" or "In the text, which point does [character] most directly make about...?"

Step 2: Write the Text

    Select a Topic: Choose a topic from science, history, social studies, or literature/humanities that is appropriate for the chosen task and difficulty.

    Draft the Text (4-12 sentences):

        For literary or historical sources, include a one-sentence italicized introduction to provide necessary context (e.g., The following text is from Shyam Selvadurai's 1994 novel Funny Boy.).

        Align the writing style with the difficulty. For a Hard text, build a nuanced argument. For example, start with a common belief and then pivot using a phrase like, "But as scholars have argued..." to introduce a more complex view. Use metaphor, complex sentence structures, and parenthetical asides to increase the interpretive challenge.

Step 3: Formulate the Question Stem

Select the appropriate question stem from the list in Step 1 that precisely matches your chosen core task.
Step 4: Craft the Answer Choices

    Write the Correct Answer (Key): The answer must be unambiguously supported by the text and must directly address the specific task in the question.

        For a detail question, it should be a close paraphrase of an explicit statement.

        For a main idea question, it must be a synthesis of the entire passage's message.

        For an inference/complex main idea question, it must accurately capture the text's central nuance or logical implication.

    Write Three Plausible Distractors: These should be appealing but demonstrably incorrect.

        The Out-of-Scope: A statement that is plausible or related to the topic but is not mentioned in or supported by the provided text. For Easy questions, this may be unrelated; for Hard questions, it's often a tempting real-world assumption.

        The Detail as Main Idea: A statement that is factually true according to the text but represents a supporting detail, an example, or a subordinate point, not the central thesis. (Highly effective for Medium/Hard main idea questions).

        The Mischaracterization / Subtle Twist: A statement that uses keywords and concepts from the text but alters their meaning, relationship, or scope. This is the key to creating effective Hard distractors.

            Qualification Error: The text says "one or both" or "some," but the distractor says "both" or "all." (e.g., Question ID 0a017199).

            Relationship Error: The text presents two things with pros and cons, but the distractor claims one is superior. Or the text says a feature is not unique to a genre, but the distractor implies it is. (e.g., Question ID 12b370c2).

            Contradiction: The text says a study supported a prediction, but the distractor claims it contradicted it.

Step 5: Write the Rationale

    For the Correct Answer: Explain why this choice is correct by referencing specific text evidence (words, phrases, or logic) and linking it to the question's task.

    For the Distractors: Explain the specific flaw of each choice, using the archetypes from Step 4 (e.g., "This choice is incorrect because it focuses on a supporting detail, not the main idea," or "This choice mischaracterizes the text's claim by presenting a qualified possibility as a certainty.").
