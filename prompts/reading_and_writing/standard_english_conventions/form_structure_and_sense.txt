Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test fundamental grammatical rules in clear, straightforward sentences. The error should be obvious once the rule is known.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Plural vs. Possessive Nouns: The context clearly demands simple plural or possessive forms. The sentence will contain phrases like "multiple stories of multiple people" to guide the student.

        (See example ID df572c56: "tell the ___ who made..." requires plural stories and plural immigrants.)

    B. Verb Tense Consistency: A sentence describes a present, ongoing action or a simple past event. The correct verb must match the tense of other verbs in the sentence or the time context provided (e.g., "Each night," "In 1990").

        (See example ID 9557577d: "Each night... the source of the glow is... A lamp... ___ the green glass." requires present tense illuminates.)

    C. Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement (Number): The sentence has a clear, singular antecedent (like a person's name) that requires a singular pronoun (he, she, it).

        (See example ID 7128cc21: "Félix González-Torres... ___ created additional installations." requires singular He.)

    D. Basic Finite vs. Non-finite Verb: A simple main clause is missing its main verb. The options include non-finite forms (-ing, to [verb]), with only one finite verb choice.

        (See example ID 4ade5ddd: "A recent study ___ why..." requires a finite verb like explains.)

Step 2: Construct the Sentence and Choices

    Write a clear sentence with a simple structure. Place the blank (___) where the grammatical form is needed.

    The correct answer will be the standard grammatical form.

    Distractors will be common errors: confusing plural and possessive (peoples for people's), using the wrong tense, mismatching pronoun number, or using a non-finite verb where a finite one is required.

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test core grammatical rules in sentences with slightly more complex structures, often involving compound subjects, introductory phrases, or logical verb tense shifts.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Verb Tense in Context: The sentence describes events in the past, but the context requires a specific past tense (e.g., simple past vs. future-in-the-past). The student must use contextual clues (like dates or other verb tenses in the sentence) to choose the logical tense.

        (See example ID cf86d6fd: "By the time Hawaiian king Kamehameha III ___ the throne, the number... had drastically increased..." signals the simple past ascended is needed.)

    B. Subject-Verb Agreement with an Intervening Phrase: The subject and verb are separated by a prepositional phrase containing a noun of a different number. This tests whether the student can correctly identify the true subject.

        (See example ID 87eb538d: "Because a cycle [singular] of lunar phases [plural] ___ 29.5 days..." requires the singular verb takes.)

    C. Possessive Nouns with Pronoun Agreement: The choice requires both a correctly formed possessive noun and a possessive determiner (its/their) that agrees with it in number.

        (See example ID c709441f: "The [singular] phrase's simplicity masks [singular] its complexity." requires phrase's and its.)

    D. Finite Verb in a Main Clause (with compound subject): A long sentence has a compound subject ("gestures and habit") and requires a finite verb to be complete. Distractors will offer non-finite forms that create sentence fragments.

        (See example ID 1007161b: "His energetic gestures...and his habit... ___ transform the role..." requires the finite verb helped.)

Step 2: Construct the Sentence and Choices

    Write a sentence with a more complex structure than an Easy question. Use introductory clauses or place descriptive phrases between the subject and verb.

    The correct answer correctly applies the rule in this more complex context.

    Distractors will represent common mistakes: agreeing the verb with the object of the preposition instead of the subject, using the wrong verb tense for the context, or creating a sentence fragment.

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test complex or less-common grammatical rules in dense, sophisticated sentences that require careful logical and structural analysis.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Subject-Modifier Placement (Dangling/Misplaced Modifiers): The sentence begins with a long introductory modifying phrase. The blank that follows must be filled with the noun that is logically being modified. All other choices create a dangling modifier.

        (See example IDs 3b9318f2 and a38e3b40: "In assessing the films..., ___ have missed..." requires the noun being modified, many critics, to immediately follow the comma.)

    B. Subject-Verb Agreement with a Complex Subject: The subject is a complex phrase like "each one of these plays," which is grammatically singular despite referring to multiple items. The student must identify the singular head of the noun phrase ("each one") and choose a singular verb.

        (See example ID ff4676f7: "Although each one [singular] of these plays, which include...and..., ___ on a single figure..." requires the singular verb focuses.)

    C. Finite Verb for a Clause (within complex sentences): The sentence contains multiple clauses, and a subordinate or relative clause is missing its finite verb. The context may require an unusual but logical verb form, like the future-in-the-past ("would acknowledge").

        (See example IDs 638832ee and 7405d67a: "...the IAU ___ the contributions..." requires a finite verb like would finally acknowledge to complete the sentence.)

    D. Pronoun Case and Logical Connection: The sentence requires a pronoun that not only agrees with its antecedent but also functions correctly as the subject of the subsequent clause, often establishing a logical connection (e.g., contrast). This can blend with Modifier Placement.

        (This is a variant of the dangling modifier where the pronoun itself can create the error. E.g., "In assessing Kurosawa's films, it is often noted that..." would be incorrect because "it" is not what is doing the assessing.)

Step 2: Construct the Sentence and Choices

    Write a long, formal sentence with sophisticated vocabulary and multiple subordinate clauses or phrases to increase cognitive load and obscure the core grammatical relationships.

    The correct choice will be the only one that creates a logically and grammatically sound sentence.

    Distractors will be tempting because they might sound plausible at first glance but create subtle yet critical grammatical errors like dangling modifiers or subject-verb disagreement.

# Notes

Not all of the questions should be of this form: By methodically mapping the palindromic repeats in bacterial DNA and later identifying the crucial role of the Cas9 protein, a process that spanned several years of intensive research, ___ the foundational principles of what would become a revolutionary gene-editing tool.

A. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier established, B. the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system established, C. it was through the work of Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier that, D. the foundational principles of a revolutionary gene-editing tool were established by

Right now, all of questions have answers like A correct, where there is a sentence that starts with a subject and then an action. Mix things up a bit!
