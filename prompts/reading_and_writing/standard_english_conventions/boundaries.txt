Level 1: Easy Difficulty

Goal: To test fundamental, high-frequency punctuation rules in clear, simple sentence structures.

Step 1: Choose an "Easy" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Introductory Phrase/Clause: The sentence begins with a standard introductory element that must be separated from the main clause by a comma.

        (See example ID e803340a: "Hoping to help..., Huerta left...")

    B. Joining Two Independent Clauses: The sentence connects two distinct, complete sentences using a comma plus a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).

        (See example ID 5631e99d: "Scientists had thought X, but the Lund team's finding...")

    C. Separating Two Independent Clauses: The sentence connects two distinct, complete sentences using end-stop punctuation (period or semicolon). The surrounding text should make the two-sentence structure logical.

        (See example ID 562d4b57: "...in corporate settings. She founded...")

    D. Non-essential "Such As" Phrase: An independent clause is followed by a non-essential example introduced by "such as." This requires a comma before "such as."

        (See example ID 72ba319f: "...in a movie, such as the scent of roses...")

Step 2: Construct the Sentence

    Write a clear sentence or two sentences based on your chosen scenario.

    Keep the clauses relatively short and grammatically simple.

    Place the blank (___) at the exact point where the punctuation is required.

Step 3: Craft the Answer Choices

    Correct Answer: The choice that uses the correct punctuation for the simple scenario.

    Distractors:

        A choice that creates a run-on sentence (no punctuation).

        A choice that creates a comma splice (a comma where a stronger boundary is needed).

        A choice that misuses a different punctuation mark (e.g., a semicolon where a comma is needed).

Level 2: Medium Difficulty

Goal: To test standard punctuation rules in sentences with slightly more complex structures or to test for common over-punctuation errors.

Step 1: Choose a "Medium" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. The Comma Splice Test: The blank separates two longer, complete independent clauses. The correct answer could be a period, a semicolon, or a comma plus a coordinating conjunction. The main task is for the student to recognize the two complete thoughts.

        (See example ID bcaf68f5: "...service recovery paradox, and research suggests...")

    B. Paired Punctuation for an Aside: An interrupting phrase (an aside or non-essential appositive) is placed in the middle of a clause. One piece of punctuation (a comma or dash) is already provided; the student must supply the matching punctuation mark to close the pair.

        (See example ID b79670a7: "...of the figures, according to Swentzell, represents her idea...")

    C. No Punctuation Between Subject and Verb: A long or complex subject is followed by its verb. The correct choice is no punctuation, but distractors will tempt students to add a comma, colon, or dash.

        (See example ID 9360277c: "...the Huntington Library in California ___ received a collection...")

    D. Appositive Followed by a Modifier: An appositive (a noun phrase that renames another noun) is followed by a participial phrase. The student must correctly place a comma between these two supplementary elements.

        (See example ID 8e27d086: "...mycology, the study of fungi, producing more than 350 paintings...")

Step 2: Construct the Sentence

    Write a sentence that is longer and contains more descriptive phrases than an Easy question.

    Embed prepositional phrases or other elements to slightly obscure the core sentence structure.

Step 3: Craft the Answer Choices

    Correct Answer: The choice that correctly applies the medium-difficulty rule.

    Distractors:

        Choices that show a lack of punctuation where some is needed, or unnecessary punctuation where none is needed.

        A choice that creates a comma splice.

        A choice that fails to use matching punctuation for an aside (e.g., using a comma to open and a dash to close).

Level 3: Hard Difficulty

Goal: To test nuanced punctuation rules in grammatically complex and dense sentences, often requiring a deep understanding of clause and phrase types.

Step 1: Choose a "Hard" Scenario (Select ONE)

    A. Complex Series with Semicolons: The sentence contains a list of three or more items, where the items themselves contain internal commas (e.g., to set off dates, locations, or descriptive phrases). This requires the use of semicolons to separate the main items in the list.

        (See example ID 971ed23e: "...app, Chickasaw Basic, in 2009; an online television network, Chickasaw TV, in 2010; and a language course...")

    B. Restrictive Appositive (No Punctuation): The sentence contains a noun phrase specified by an essential (restrictive) appositive. The correct choice is no punctuation. This is difficult because the appositive looks like it should be set off by commas, but it is essential for identifying the noun.

        (See example ID 4cff8c23: "...twentieth-century US artists Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock...")

    C. Long Introductory Clause: The sentence begins with a very long and complex introductory clause or phrase containing its own subordinate elements. The correct choice is still a single comma to separate it from the main clause, but the complexity will tempt students to use a stronger boundary marker.

        (See example ID 80b2b9da: "With a blend of...and modern ones..., transitional design splits...")

    D. Sentence Split with a Complex Modifier: The blank separates two full sentences, but the second sentence begins with a long introductory modifier (e.g., a participial phrase). This creates a very tempting comma splice trap; the correct answer must be a period or semicolon.

        (See example ID 537fd30f: "...crowd-monitoring system. Analyzing video..., the AI algorithm...")

Step 2: Construct the Sentence

    Write a long, dense sentence with multiple phrases and clauses to increase cognitive load.

    Use sophisticated vocabulary and formal academic tone.

    Carefully place the blank (___) at the critical punctuation point defined by your hard scenario.

Step 3: Craft the Answer Choices

    Correct Answer: The choice that correctly applies the nuanced punctuation rule.

    Distractors:

        A choice that creates a comma splice (the most common trap in Hard questions).

        A choice that misuses semicolons or periods within a single sentence.

        A choice that incorrectly uses commas, often by setting off a restrictive element or failing to use semicolons in a complex list.

        A choice that results in a run-on sentence.

Try to mix up words a little better, it feels like the same trick is being used with a lot of the questions.
