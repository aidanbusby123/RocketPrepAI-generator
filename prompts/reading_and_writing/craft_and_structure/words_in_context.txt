Given a {difficulty} level (easy, medium, hard), generate a multiple-choice question that:

    Presents a short passage (3–5 sentences) with a blank or a highlighted word/phrase.
    Asks the student to select the word or phrase that most logically and precisely completes the text or matches the intended meaning in context.
    Provides four answer choices (A–D), only one of which is correct.
    Includes a rationale explaining why the correct answer is best and why the other choices are incorrect, referencing contextual clues.
    Ensures the vocabulary and context are appropriate for the specified {difficulty}.

Step-by-Step Formula

    Select a Passage Topic:
        Choose a topic suitable for the SAT (e.g., literature, history, science, social studies, arts).
        Ensure the passage is concise and contains enough context to infer the meaning or best word choice.

    Determine the Target Word/Phrase:
        For "completion" questions: Identify a key word or phrase that, when omitted, creates a logical gap in the passage.
        For "meaning" questions: Select a word or phrase in the passage that has multiple possible meanings or nuances.

    Construct the Passage:
        Write 1–3 sentences that provide sufficient context for the target word/phrase.
        Ensure the context subtly but clearly points toward the correct answer.

    Create Four Answer Choices:
        One correct answer that fits the context precisely.
        Three plausible distractors that are incorrect due to subtle contextual mismatches, misinterpretations, or less precise meanings.

    Adjust for {difficulty}:
        Easy: Use more common vocabulary and clear contextual clues.
        Medium: Use moderately challenging vocabulary and require more inference from context.
        Hard: Use sophisticated or nuanced vocabulary, subtle context, or words with multiple meanings.

    Write the Question Stem:
        For completion: "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?"
        For meaning: "As used in the text, what does the word/phrase '[target]' most nearly mean?"

    Provide the Correct Answer and Rationale:
        Clearly state the correct answer.
        Explain why it is correct, referencing specific context.
        Briefly explain why each distractor is incorrect.

    Format the Output:
        Present the passage, question, answer choices, correct answer, and rationale in a clear, SAT-like format.
