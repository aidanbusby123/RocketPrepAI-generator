        "content": "##### Individual elephants and Arctic herbivores such as caribou tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughouttheir lifetimes, which had prompted some researchers to speculate that the Arctic woolly mammoth, anextinct elephantid, might have exhibited similar behavior. Mammoth tusks grew in sequential layers,incorporating ingested minerals and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the ratio of strontiumisotopes ( Sr/ Sr) in the local environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows where the animal roamedduring life. Recent analysis of the strontium ratios in the strata of one Arctic woolly mammoth tusk in relationto the geographic distribution of strontium ratios in the environment shows the animal’s range begin toexpand as it reached sexual maturity, only to contract again in its final 1.5 years.Which choice best describes the function of the underlined statement in the text as a whole?A. It discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised apossibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.B. It illustrates a pattern of behavior among certain animals in order to present a theory about exceptions tothat pattern that is weakened by a finding described later in the text.C. It describes a similarity in the behavior of certain animals in order to show why a method described laterin the text did not reveal whether another animal also showed that behavior.D. It introduces a trait shared by certain animals in order to contextualize a hypothesis about the origin ofthat trait that is advanced later in the text.### Correct Answer: A### RationaleChoice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as awhole. The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixedgeographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arcticwoolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (orlayers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis, the mammoth had an expandingrange in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristicshared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by datadescribed later in the text.Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals ofstaying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather,the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice Cis incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency tostay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed toshow whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tuskshowed that the mammoth’s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. ChoiceD is incorrect. Though the underlined statement mentions a trait shared by a number of animals (their fixed geographicrange), the rest of the text does not present a hypothesis regarding the origin of that trait; rather, the researchers areconcerned with whether another particular animal shares that trait.### Question Difficulty: Hard"

        "content": "##### The following text is adapted from Herman Melville’s 1855 novel Israel Potter. Israel is a young manwandering through New England during the late eighteenth century.He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acresof land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land,and there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it, Israel—who, however brave-hearted, andeven much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts ofhis career, a singular patience and mildness—was obliged to look round for other means of livelihoodthan clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?A. It implies that Israel treasures a particular characteristic of his personality when that characteristic shouldusually be regarded as a flaw.B. It suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwartedin his ambition to establish a farm.C. It shows why Israel would not have been able to undertake the enormous amount of labor necessary torun a farm even if he had owned the necessary property.D. It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that otherswould generally avoid.### Correct Answer: B### RationaleChoice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The textdescribes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: accordingto his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused tofulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to findanother means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, theunderlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he alsopossessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but hewas usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of.Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easilythwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not addresshow he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasionalcourage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate afarm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could becourageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather thathe was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would notexplain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature,cheated of the property to which he had a right.### Question Difficulty: Hard"

        "content": "### Question Difficulty: Medium##### In Jane Austen’s novel Mansfield Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawfordcauses the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is awareof it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry’s mental state through his gestures, but also infersthat he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls“deep intersubjectivity,” a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through whichAusten’s novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?A. It states a claim about Austen’s skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by anexample presented in the following sentence.B. It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from otherAusten novels cited in the following sentence.C. It describes a recurring theme in Austen’s novels that is the focus of a literary scholar’s analysissummarized in the following sentence.D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed inthe following sentence.### Correct Answer: D### RationaleChoice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers’ understanding of the“deep intersubjectivity” described in the next sentence as central to Austen’s work.Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen’s skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in thefollowing sentence. This choice essentially flips the paragraph: it’s this first sentence that provides an example. Choice B isincorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn’t be the answer. Choice C isincorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t identify any “recurring theme,” but instead simply describes one interaction fromone book. This interaction exemplifies the literary technique of “deep intersubjectivity” that is introduced in the nextsentence.### Question Difficulty: Hard"
