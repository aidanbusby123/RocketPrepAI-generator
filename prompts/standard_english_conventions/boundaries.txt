Step 1: Select a Specific Punctuation Rule to Test
Choose a single, specific rule about sentence boundaries as the core of your question. Examples include:

    Separating two independent clauses.

    Separating an introductory phrase/clause from a main clause.

    Setting off a non-essential (non-restrictive) element.

    Integrating an essential (restrictive) element.

    Using a colon to introduce an explanation or list.

    Using paired punctuation (commas, dashes, parentheses).

Step 2: Craft the Sentence(s)
Write a high-quality, engaging sentence that creates a clear need for the chosen punctuation rule. Place the blank (___) at the precise point where the boundary decision must be made. The content of the sentence is important; use it to guide the student or, for harder questions, to misdirect them.

Step 3: Write the Correct Answer
Provide the word or phrase plus the grammatically correct punctuation that satisfies the rule from Step 1.

Step 4: Design Common-Error Distractors
Create three incorrect choices. These must be based on common, predictable student errors related to the rule being tested. Every distractor should correspond to a specific grammatical mistake. The most common errors to use are:

    Comma Splice: Incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma.

    Run-On (Fused) Sentence: Joining two independent clauses with no punctuation or conjunction.

    Sentence Fragment: Creating an incomplete sentence by using a period incorrectly.

    Incorrect Conjunction Use: e.g., using ", and" to join a dependent and independent clause, or using just "and" between two long independent clauses where a comma is conventional.

    Mismatched Paired Punctuation: e.g., starting a parenthetical with a dash and ending with a comma.

Difficulty-Specific Instructions

EASY Difficulty:

    Rule Focus: Use a single, fundamental rule in a short, clear sentence. Good rules to test are:

        Joining two independent clauses with a period.

        Joining two independent clauses with a comma and a FANBOYS conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).

        Setting off a simple introductory phrase with a comma.

    Distractors: Use the most common errors directly: a comma splice, a run-on, and perhaps one other obvious misuse of punctuation like a semicolon.

MEDIUM Difficulty:

    Rule Focus: Use slightly more complex rules or sentence structures.

        Setting off a non-essential element in the middle of a sentence using paired commas or paired dashes.

        Using a semicolon to join two closely related independent clauses.

        Using a colon to introduce a list or simple explanation.

    Sentence Structure: The sentences can be longer, requiring the student to track the relationship between clauses across more words.

    Distractors: The distractors should still be clear errors but can be more varied, such as testing mismatched paired punctuation or misusing a colon.

HARD Difficulty:

    Rule Focus: The difficulty must come from subtlety, misdirection, or testing exceptions to common rules. Do not just make the sentence longer; make the grammatical decision itself more complex.

    Techniques for Creating Hard Questions:

        The "Punctuation Void" (Testing Restrictive Elements): This is the most effective technique. Create a sentence where the correct answer is the absence of punctuation. This is difficult because it's counter-intuitive. Frame the sentence so it looks like it needs a comma, but the grammar forbids it.

            Example Structure: [Complex Noun Phrase] that [essential clause]. Place the blank before "that."

            Example Structure: [Title] [Name] or [Noun] [Prepositional Phrase] where the name/phrase is essential to the sentence's meaning (restrictive). Place the blank between the elements to tempt the student into adding a comma.

        Grammatical Misdirection: Use a familiar sentence pattern to disguise a different underlying structure.

            Example: Use a list structure (A, B, and C) where "C" is immediately followed by an essential "that" clause. The student will be tempted to put a comma after "C" because of the list pattern, but the restrictive clause forbids it.

        Rule Stacking: Create a boundary that requires the correct application of two rules simultaneously.

            Example: A choice that must correctly set off a supplementary phrase with a comma and use a colon to introduce the next clause, all within one answer option. The distractors will get one part right but the other wrong.

    Hard Distractors: The distractors for a hard question must be sophisticated. They should also use punctuation and appear to be grammatically complex, but contain a subtle, fatal flaw based on the techniques above. Avoid simple run-ons or comma splices as distractors here; they make the correct answer too obvious.

Dolores Huerta’s advocacy on behalf of farmworkers was rooted in her experience as a schoolteacher in
Stockton, California, in the early 1950s. Hoping to help her students and their families outside the ______
Huerta left teaching to start the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization, a group focused
on the needs of local farmworkers.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. classroom.
B. classroom;
C. classroom,
D. classroom

Correct Answer: C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice correctly
uses a comma to mark the boundary between the introductory participial phrase ("Hoping…classroom") and the main clause
("Huerta…farmworkers").
Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "hoping." Choice B is
incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between the participial phrase ("Hoping…
classroom") and the main clause ("Huerta…farmworkers"). Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary
between the participial phrase ("Hoping…classroom") and the main clause ("Huerta…farmworkers").

Eli Eisenberg, a genetics expert at Tel Aviv University in Israel, recently discovered that ______ have a special
genetic ability called RNA editing that confers evolutionary advantages.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. cephalopods, ocean dwellers that include the squid, the octopus, and the cuttlefish
B. cephalopods—ocean dwellers—that include the squid, the octopus, and the cuttlefish,
C. cephalopods, ocean dwellers that include: the squid, the octopus, and the cuttlefish,
D. cephalopods—ocean dwellers that include the squid, the octopus, and the cuttlefish—

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence.
In this choice, the dash after "cephalopods" pairs with the dash after "cuttlefish" to clearly separate the supplementary
element "ocean dwellers that include the squid, the octopus, and the cuttlefish" from the rest of the sentence. This
supplementary element functions to explain what cephalopods are, and the pair of dashes indicates that this element could
be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.
Choice A is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element that explains
what cephalopods are from the rest of the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to
separate the supplementary element that explains what cephalopods are from the rest of the sentence. Choice C is incorrect
because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element that explains what cephalopods are
from the rest of the sentence.

On March 23, 2021, a gust of wind wreaked havoc on global trade. Ever Given, an international shipping
container vessel, became lodged in Egypt’s Suez Canal, a major shipping route between Europe and Asia. The
vessel took six days to ______ it’s as heavy as two thousand blue whales when fully loaded.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. dislodge in part due to its sheer size,
B. dislodge, in part due to its sheer size:
C. dislodge, in part due to its sheer size,
D. dislodge, in part, due to its sheer size

Correct Answer: B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between main clauses and a supplementary
element. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause ("The vessel took six days to
dislodge") and the supplementary element ("in part due to its sheer size") that provides additional information on why the
vessel was difficult to dislodge. Additionally, this choice correctly uses a colon to introduce another main clause that
describes the vessel’s size ("it’s as heavy as two thousand blue whales when fully loaded").
Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between
two main clauses ("The vessel…size" and "it’s…loaded"). Additionally, it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause
("The vessel took six days to dislodge") and the supplementary element ("in part due to its sheer size"). Choice C is incorrect
because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between two main clauses
("The vessel…size" and "it’s…loaded"). Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses
("The vessel…size" and "it’s…loaded") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

In 2000, Nora de Hoyos Comstock, herself an owner of a successful consulting firm, sought to increase
Latina representation in corporate ______ founded Las Comadres para las Americas, an international
community that for over two decades has served as a resource and information network for Latina business
professionals.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. settings she
B. settings, she
C. settings and she
D. settings. She

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. It appropriately uses a period to mark the end of one independent clause ("In 2000…settings")
and the start of another ("She founded…professionals").
Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence error. Both the clause before the blank ("In 2000…settings")
and the clause after the blank ("she…professionals") are independent clauses, so they need to be separated by punctuation.
Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with just a
comma. Linking two independent clauses with a comma also requires the use of a coordinating conjunction (like for, and,
nor, but, or, yet, or so). Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, an error caused when two independent
clauses are joined without punctuation or appropriate conjunctions. Since both the clause before the blank ("In 2000…
settings") and the clause after the blank ("she…professionals") are independent, a comma would be required in addition to
the coordinating conjunction "and."

Po’Pay was a Tewa leader from Ohkay Owingeh, a pueblo located about twenty-five miles north of present-
day Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was instrumental in organizing the Pueblo Revolt of ______ as a result of his
leadership, the Spanish colonizers were expelled from the region for a time.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. 1680
B. 1680 and
C. 1680,
D. 1680, and

Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “and” to join the first main clause (“He…1680”) and the second
main clause (“as…time”).
Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a
conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to
use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a
conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses.
Question Difficulty: Medium

Stomata, tiny pore structures in a leaf that absorb gases needed for plant growth, open when guard cells
surrounding each pore swell with water. In a pivotal 2007 article, plant cell ______ showed that lipid molecules
called phosphatidylinositol phosphates are responsible for signaling guard cells to open stomata.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. biologist, Yuree Lee
B. biologist Yuree Lee,
C. biologist Yuree Lee
D. biologist, Yuree Lee,

Correct Answer: C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and proper nouns. No
punctuation is needed to offset the proper noun "Yuree Lee" from the title "plant cell biologist" that describes Lee.
Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Choice D
is incorrect because no punctuation is needed around the proper noun "Yuree Lee." Setting the phrase off with punctuation
suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case.

Typically, underlines, scribbles, and notes left in the margins by a former owner lower a book’s ______ when
the former owner is a famous poet like Walt Whitman, such markings, known as marginalia, can be a gold
mine to literary scholars.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. value, but
B. value
C. value,
D. value but

Correct Answer: A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An
independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a
comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first independent clause (“underlines…lower a book’s value”) and
the second independent clause (“such markings…can be a gold mine to scholars”) to create a compound sentence.
Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses are fused without punctuation
and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark
the boundary between two independent clauses. Choice D is incorrect because a comma is needed to mark the boundary
between two coordinated independent clauses.

By analyzing the level of radioactive decay within a fossil specimen, scientists can establish the age of that
fossil with a high degree of precision. When radioactive elements aren’t present, scientists turn to ______
analysis of Earth’s sediment layers (strata)—to estimate how old a fossil is based on the age of the strata in
which the fossil is found.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. stratigraphy—the
B. stratigraphy (the
C. stratigraphy: the
D. stratigraphy, the

Correct Answer: A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. The dash after
"stratigraphy" pairs with the dash after "(strata)" to separate the supplementary element "the analysis of Earth’s sediment
layers (strata)" from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element functions to define the term "stratigraphy," and the
pair of dashes indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.
Choice B is incorrect because a parenthesis can’t be paired with a dash in this way to separate the supplementary element
from the rest of the sentence. Choice C is incorrect because a colon can’t be paired with a dash in this way to separate the
supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect because a comma can’t be paired with a dash in
this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.

Roughly 300 nights a year, when the cold air descending from the Andes Mountains meets the warm air
rising from Venezuela’s coastal Lake Maracaibo, the result is a spectacular lightning storm, its strikes so
bright, so localized, and so ______ that it has become known as “Maracaibo’s Lighthouse.”
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?
A. dependable:
B. dependable;
C. dependable
D. dependable,

Correct Answer: C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of an integrated relative clause. No punctuation
is needed before the relative clause beginning with "that" because the content of the relative clause ("that...Lighthouse") is
integral to the meaning of the coordinated adjectival phrase ("so bright, so localized, and so dependable") that it modifies.
Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the coordinated adjectival phrase ("so bright...dependable")
and the integrated relative clause that modifies it. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the
coordinated adjectival phrase ("so bright...dependable") and the integrated relative clause that modifies it. Choice D is
incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the coordinated adjectival phrase ("so bright...dependable") and the
integrated relative clause that modifies it.
